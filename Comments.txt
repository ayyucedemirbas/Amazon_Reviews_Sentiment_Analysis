          Very nice and classic looking watch with added benefit of date window & radium for night use. Good built quality of watch and leather straps are also made of good materials. Got delivered in 2 days only. Superb watch at reasonable pricing...!!!! Thank you Amazon.
          This is my personal feedback as per my preference.I bought this watch along with the CHAPS watch.I found the overall look & functionality of CHAPS better than this one.The dial does not look much attractive to me as it looks & feels bulky but not big, also there is a big bezel which steals away the look.Although the overall quality is superb, no doubt about it as its a watch by Titan.So decide for urself as I have attached couple of pictures to justify my feedback.
          The watch looks magnificent. But the box in which the watch was packed by the seller is very dusty.
          Nice product and,  cool looking must buy everyone Prefer to buy under 2k

          I got this product on October 2019 some time and on November 2019 i.e. with in a month it stopped working. Not sure if battery is died or what. I cant return as well since it's more than an month now and I missed by few days only.
          Recieved it in less than 12 hours of ordering. Brought it for my father and he liked it. Its sleek and best in this range. The dial is bright and the numbers also are bright which makes it easire to read. The built quility is excellent. The leather is of very good quality and the steel feels premium.
          I gifted this to my father.Excellent product
          The watch is better than it looks in the picture. I liked the strap very much. Bought it for my brother and he liked it.
          It's Very nice and classic looking watch. Also with added benefit of date window &amp; radium for night use. leather straps are also made of good materials.Superb watch at reasonable pricing...!!!!
          I have been wearing so many watches from my early childhood and this watch was one of the best I have ever had. It do good. I can't tell you how good it goes with all the causal and formals as well. It's a pretty amazing watch for the price it comes.
          Its a beautiful watch , but the strap is towards camel brown and not whats shown in the pictures
          Nice watch with such a lovely dial design, wrist belt is also looking so good. I purchased it in Rs. 2075,and I found it's worth purchasing. Packaging is very good. I am going to order more watch of same design. Thank you Amazon üòçüòä
          In this price it is absolutely fine .The  looks of it is well and composed. If there is some more bigger, then it will be fantastic, for normal size hand it fits good but for bigger hands it doesn't fits. If ur thinking for  a casual  look then go for it.
          Super duper hit,excellent product  keep it up Amazon, my second partner Amazon.... Thanks
          First of all I appreciate the packing, and next the dial was superb.only a lil bit dissatisfaction is with the belt.its not genuine leather as mentioned and its seems to come off so soon!! You can go for thisüëç
          Very Nice Wrist Watch with dial and strap I like it so much. But I think I'll have to return because Date function is not working properly after using 5 days so I'm gona return this.
          Reviewing after 2 months use.. titans best watch under 1.5k ..
          I am using the watch since last 2 months,its working nicely and looking awesone. Wrist band is good,dial is attractive,till now no scratches after felldown 2-3 times. But the rate is little high.
          Not water proof but as my experience it is not get affected with little water
          Gifted to dad and working fine from past 2 months.
          Stylish and durable. A fantastic buy.
          Great product !! I gave it as a gift to my dad and he loved it. The built quality is great and feels premium
          Good product.The belt of watch is not of the same colour which is shown in the pictureSee reviews for actual colour of the belt.Rest everything is good.
          The watch is as per my expectations. Light weight but sturdy.
          I look there is a problem with the data.  which contains same repeated data like starts from ever  month 1 to 31 .so what about the other month????...like February.please exlpain for this ..üëàüëà
          Does look premium on your hand.....Amazon delivered this product in perfect condition üëå

          Average product
          Good one at best price just 1088
          Good quality
          Good one
          It is a nice purchase for the given price. The packing was done efficiently so that there was no water damage to the watch. Also the delivery executive followed all the appropriate measures for no-contact delivery.
          Good product with good built in quality the strap is seems to be have longer life than those fakes leatherone
          Good looking. But could be tricky to see the time if phosphorescent dial isn't activated
          This watch looks great. Accurate time. Good packaging
          Titan watch are best quality but I felt that I was cheated by seller. They sell me a defective piece Because after some days it`s date is not working well  I have to set it every day.
          Loved this watch !!
          Deliver product band colour different than showing in pic
          Good for gifting someone. Titan as usual is a trusted brand. Belt colour varies from the pic. Its slightly lighter.
          Built quality is goodBut not scratch resistantNo light or illuminator
          Small straps, no width but look classy
          Good but Not so great at this price tag
          Nice
          Delivered on time by amazon and it is a stunning piece though. Feels super comfy in hand and looks great as well.
          All are good but the leather quality and belt design  is not enough with the titan product
          Cover box cheap: TITAN printed on box seems fake. No warranty card stamped and as per titan policy it should be stamped. Returned it for same reason but again they sent same product
          Good product overall especially the dials
          Bought it a month back as a gift. One month down the line it does'nt work properly.
          It fit well with my wrist.. Good quality
          This watch is super good-looking..i am happy with this watch
          Really fits well my wrist...liked it...
          Good and stylish but not seen any light and not checked with water resistance
          Good productGo for itOnly rate is little higher it should be between 1500 to 1800
          This is awesome watch for me and reasonable price watch quality is excellent and belt are also good quality colour are same on shown the picture at a time of purchase
          Loyal to the core. The look, the feel, the weight, the package and etc, all are perfectly calibrated.

          Value for the money. I gifted for my relative and he liked it very much.
          Excellent product
          good but if you expect big dial than it's not for you
          Color diffrs frm the actual one..
          Very elegant watch.  Looks perfect. Certainly one of the best
          only reason to give 4 was the dial size is slightly smaller than what i expected. rest is all good.
          Great watch at great price....loved the product.
          Nice build, only thing is i don't like is numbers are not radiate in dark like hands.
          I gifted this watch and receiver loved it
          Decent product. Have flurocent in needles to see time in night time.
          This watch is so nice and built quality is very good and also it looks very üòéValue for money.
          I like the watch . But the strap is bit small . If you have bigger wrist than this product not recommended.
          Product was very good, not a big dial who are expected for big dial don't buy it, otherwise watch absolutely perfect.
          Well but its leather belt damaged after 6 month used....
          I ordered this watch for my loving husband to his bdy and he was happy for this beautiful gift.

          price is too much high. Thickness is well.

          Warranty wont covered by local dealer or titan authorised service centre
          Useless fake product
          Excellent
          Great time with Titan
          I received the watch this week and overall I am pretty pleased with the purchase.  The only area of concern would be the length of the watch.  I don't have overly large wrists in fact I would describe them as average but the length of the band is short in comparison to bands on other watches that I own. I guess I'll have to buy a longer band because I like the watch.
          I wore it as soon as i pulled it out of the package. Been wearing it pretty much every single day. It's minimal enough to be worn with a dress shirt or a polo. Not too big not too small, just bold enough to grab attention.
          Nice watch that looks attractive, however the watchband is very short.  I have relatively narrow wrists for a man, and I have to use the last hole in the band to fasten it.
          Watch does looks good professionally and it is as per the description in the site. Only the leather strap is bit rusty so bit difficult to buckle up.
          This watch is very comfortable to wear and keeps excellent time Accuracy. With a very  stylish look ,I am very satisfied with my purchase. Thank you
          Leather belt not flexible

          Absolutely elegant, value for money.
          It's simply awesome.... It's looks great than this picture... Loved it... I brought this for my hubby üòç
          Little costly compared to other designs but nice product
