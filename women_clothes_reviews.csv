  Ordered it for my little sister. overall its an average product. But at this price it's difficult to find a subtle yet classy looking jacket like this.

"
"

  Quality of the material is cheap. Streacheable but very thin. The design stich on left hand side is discontinued. Not a quality product.

"
"

  Am totally impressed. This jacket at this price is unbelievable. Totally worth. I have washed it, there is not colour bleed which shows its truly denim. Aswesome and trendy.. Fit is also really comfortable. Strongly recommend this one.. totally satisfied 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻

"
"

  Quality is good... But it had a funny smell... Maybe like old stock... Not opened clothes for too long.. But the fit was a little off... I usually buy size- S but it was quite tight... it was like size xs size..

"
"

  After knowing company actual size of jacket, it is perfectly fit. It's cloth is really comfortable. Colour is same as shown in picture. Quality is too good. Measure size body with tape, see mentioned measurements then place order. Sizes are different to different companiwise.

  So cute on me😍for fat girls buy XXL i just loved it🤗this seller is very best because XXL also available in lowest price....😍😘 compared to another seller this seller is awesome, quality also good.

  Material is thin ,liked it 👍 comfortable to wear👍. 02 issues- 1- Second button is absolutely different from rest of the other buttons . side pocket button is totally missing. Disappointed ☹️☹️☹️ . Will have to look for buttons in my local market.☹️☹️☹️

  Stitching perfection I would give a zero. I returned this product. I ordered small and I received a very large one. No stitching perfection at all. I won't recommend this to anybody. The product is not good.

"
"

  Good.....The cloth is not so thick but for 400 it is good enough to get such a look.

"
"

  good

"
"

  For a price of just 400 it's a good piece. Goes well with almost everything.

"
"

  It's fine

"
"

  Nice qualityPerfect sizeGood colour

"
"

  Length of jacket is little less, colour is dull, overall is good little less as I think.

"
"

"
"

  The material is soft and skinny... Fits perfectly... Actually I am amazed to have such a good quality material in such a price...

"
"

  It is very good product but I ordered in m size but it came s size ...I exchanged it with similar product...but I didn't get it...

"
"

  It's really good. we can write it as a crop shirt or as a shrug. It's so comfy. not so tight or loose. Perfectly fit. And I really loved it. :-)

"
"

  Item is good but the delivery boy is acting like mentel he is not supposed to hear what we are telling and he is rouse person ...

"
"

  Good product

"
"

  Product looks ok. But it had a very disgusting foul smell so that we won’t even feel to put on the jacket. So returned the item

"
"

  color is not as expected I orderlight blue but when it came it was a blue and ash . Expect this balance all thing are very nice. Stretchable. Good one

"

"
"

  Worst product. No price tag was present with the product and now they won't even accept the product back. Please don't buy it. 😭👎

"
"

  It is stylish, well fit. But stitching is very poor nd I think color will not stay the same after washing. I ordered black.

"
"

"
"

  As shown in the pic..  Really liked it..

"
"

  This kurta looks  amazing  and quality  of fabric  is also soft and comfortable  the only disappointment  is its fitting because  too loose on sleeves. Overall  product  is awesome with beautiful  print.

"
"

  Nice material,  colour and design..... Value for money 👍🏻👌🏻👌🏻

"
"

  This product is so beautiful....I feel very comfortable after wearing it....Happy with this😇

"
"

  Removed the size tag and attached the size which I ordered.

"
"

  It's pure cotton. Soft n v.comfortable to wear. Also did not shrink or wrinkle after wash. Only problem little transparent as in pic. But other than that totally worth it. Just go for it...

"
"

  It looks really pretty only draw back was its fabric... it looks semi-transparant . Five stars for its color and design... pattern and fitting need some improvements

"
"

  Not so great, wife not happy

"
"

  The kurti is awesome. I have ordered my excat size and it fits really well. Also the cloth material is good. I would recommend to go for this Kurti. Thanks Om Sai latest creation designs for such wonderful kurti. I am also going to purchase other kurtis from this seller as they provide different variety, trendy and latest kurtis that too at the reasonsble price.. 👍👍👍👍

  Product description is very bad. I have initiated return. But the agent is asking for palazzo also. Why is the company is writing for palazzo n skirts instead of simple kurti? When u r giving kurti only for 400. This is misguiding. I don't know whether the agent will report correctly or not.

"
"

  M is too tight on neck line. And L is too loose on sleeves

"
"

  I just loved this one..it was soo cool and very shiny too...quality is also good.

"
"

  Size is ok .. but i ordered 2XL... it comes XL.. though even fitted on me.  Rather than Main thing is material is very bad.. actually its transparent.. too thin. Over all kurti is average ...

"
"

  Super❤expected the same😊

"
"

  Would look good only if you have the same figure as this model shown. That belt reveals your real figure so dress it up as per your dimensions. Fabric not so good

"
"

  Soft cotton fabric, subtle colour - exactly as in the pics. Breathable material.Gives an elegant sleek look..very comfortable to wear. The stitches are good. Overall loved the Kurta! A must have in your wardrobe. I purchased the M size for 390/-

"
"

  Not good quality. Amazon should vet the product before marketing. Do not buy.

"
"

  It was good by Looks md material....but the waist part is so small...... the fitting was gud at chest and arms....bt was tight at waist md hips....nd according to the picture there should be more flare in in bottom part of dress.... I have to return it nd order again...

"
"

  Good qualityReceived as per diplayedExcellent priceI purchased in deal hence benefitedValue for money

"
"

  It's really a beautiful kurta and fits well...No colour discharge and shrinking after wash...Price is very genuine...Must buy...

"
"

  New design and it is stylish. But fit is a little smaller. Suggest you to buy one size larger

"
"

  The body was broad and the sleeves were tightThe boat neck made it touch my chin.Very disproportionate stitching.

"
"

  I bought it for my sister.  It did not suit to her body typing hence returned.  It is okay for thin to medium body type.

"
"

  The fabric is too transparent. Sleeves are tight near elbows and uncomfortable to wear as it is tight near neck.Not worthy of 400Rs. Cheap quality fabric.

"
"

  The cloth looks thick but is sheer.  Inner is neededOverall just an average product

"
"

  Its extremely awesome....and its very comfortable...the dress colour nd design is very attractive.....and its affordable to all....its recommended.....AwesomeAttractiveExtremely goodExcellentThese words r also not enough for this dress..💖💖

"
"

  The kurta is very comfortable nd fit me very well.. value for money

"
"

  The model is good but fabric is not up to the mark.

"
"

  Nice office wear cotton kurti, pair it with cotton trousers..looks fabulous.

"
"

  Huge difference between shown in photo and real product...they shown intentionally very good pic of product on amazon ...but its worst product quality...too thickNot even worthy product..

"
"

  did a hand wash and didn't shrink. overall happy with the product.

"
"

  The print is good, fit is also good but the quality of the cloth is not up to the mark.

"
"

  Kurta is very good but the neck line is a problem...could have been a little lower as it is pressing on the neck right now and becoming uncomfortable

"
"

  i order this for my wife and she likes so much and a this wear gives different look and she is very comfortable in it. thanks alot for this

"
"

  The product is awesome... But delivery is not good... Soo much time I'm waiting on the road for my product... The delivery boy was comes very late....

"
"

  Beautiful kurta, very comfortable to wear, nice cloth qulaity.. But little bit thin cloth but ok... Good one👍

"
"

  This is for daily use fabric is too nice i thought there was thread work on shoulder but there is print .. but its ok  not soo good not soo bad but fabric is nice

"
"

  The cloth is good... But the style given in picture is cross cut but the dress has straight cut. L can be used for XL people. Can not stitch to reduce the size of the top as the thread is provided around the dress

"
"

  Excellent quality to budget price

"
"

  It is exactly as shown in the picture, quality of the material is great. Looks good. Overall a really good product

"
"

  Wonderful product, perfect fitting, perfect for pricing This is really awesome I bought this for my sister & she loved this very much.

"
"

  Looks good. But material thickness has to be increased.

"
"

  It was a very nice gift to my wife. She liked it very much.

"
"

  Good one in such a low price.....

"
"

  Product I good as I expected. Though it is not pure cotton but comfortable to wear. The color of the dres is totally same as I saw I the picture.

"
"

  Nice product liked very much

  The quality of the tights is good but size is bigger/not comfortable, I have received damaged product hence returning the same. Good to go at this reasonable price and as I said quality of the fabric is good.

"

  Material is gud,but the product sent already has some stains on it as shown in image.also the design is totally different from the image shown in website

"

  I am using it as my daily gym outfit for one month and this is good

"
"

  It's too small, looks like the size is very small only XL tag is given. But it's small size.

"
"

  I have ordered this for my wife. What she tells - Amazing

"
"

  After few wash become loose

"

  Good...

"
"

  Good product

"
"

  Loved the print,fabric,color, design .10/10 in budget 💓💓💓. Fine stitching. Only complain with the pants. That's not palazzo. It's more kind of pant. Go a size bigger as It is little tight may be after a wash it can be shrink.

"
"

  Quality issues,  stitch issues. A bit Color difference in Kurta and palazzo.

"
"

  Purchased Kurti for wife, she liked it very much, fitting was appropriate and color is vibrant and lively, while purchase written as cotton kurti and actually it is cotton thanks to maker/seller they are delivering genuine product, overall satisfied with purchase to mention color did not fade after wash..

"
"

  Good things first...the color doesn't run on wash...the cloth doesn't shrink after wash...soothing colors and style.  Cons - 1) though initially it seems like the kurta and pajama combo at 459/- is a steal,  there is a problem with the sizing...though an M (38) would normally fit me, I bought 2 sizes bigger i.e XL (42) after reading the reviews...though this fits me perfectly before and after a wash,  this fits me in a way an M size would fit....after having bought XL  I thought it would be a little looser but it wasn't...it was a perfect fit, like an M size would be normally....so be careful with the size...order atleast 2 sizes bigger...3 sizes bigger if you want it a bit loose fitting...Similarly,  the pant/pyjama for XL size is a bit tight...so,if you choose XL, you will get kurta which fits you perfectly like an M would but the pajama is a bit tight...you cannot sit on the floor/low sofa in that pajama...2) the material is not pure cotton...it is a mix of cotton and synthetic...so, in summers, it is not very comfortable for sensitive skin...  It's MRP is definitely not 2999 as shown...that quality material with that kind of fitting cannot be more than 400 to 450 rupees...

"
"

  Amazing fit....as if stitched for me only....please dont think twice.. it's a superb casual n smart looking wear...I loved it genuinely and would recommend to friends also

"
"

  Very nice product .  Washed. Also .overall very nice  Worth at this price.  but size is the issue . Problem is  that  top is proper but bottom is extremely tight .so to get comfortable bottom you need to order two size  bigger . But Than you get top very loosebut loose top can be altered so order atleast two size big if you want bottom pant comfortable.  I am basically slim built then even I find bottom right .Request  manufacturer to solve this issue .As Indian female is heavier from waist so provide bottom also  of loose  fitting .Size chart is useless . Never the size and actual peace matches .

"
"

  Stitching is very poor and uneven.At someplaces stitch is wavy which is funny.Looks like bulk production of suit has lowered the quality.We buy ready to wear apperals to avoid visiting Masterji.Guess l have to visit one for getting in shape,if l plan to keep it just to avoid delivery boy bothering me.

"
"

  Material- moderate, not complete cottonPrice- since it’s kurta set, it’s value for moneyFitting- have to buy one size larger, bcz either arms can bcm tight or chest area if u go for exact sizeColour- is gud, like sea blue

"
"

  the size chart is messed up.. ordered L according to size chart , it didn't fit  replaced for XL size it was still a bit tight  however kept it as exchanging again n again is a hassle!!!Good Kurta set for daily wear though.. I bought a matching dupatta from Amazon to complete the set ..Got a matching mask as well :)I haven't washed the product yet so wondering if it shrank if it will fit me anymore?

"
"

  Bad quality product. When I ordered M is was good but a little small and when I ordered L the produce they gave me was extremely different and in a very bad condition, it was used product and the neck was different. It was made different entiry. I don't recommend to buy from here again. Or if you do specify you need the original product

  Very nice product .  Washed. Also .overall very nice  Worth at this price.  but size is the issue . Problem is  that  top is proper but bottom is extremely tight .so to get comfortable bottom you need to order two size  bigger . But Than you get top very loosebut loose top can be altered so order atleast two size big if you want bottom pant comfortable.  I am basically slim built then even I find bottom right .Request  manufacturer to solve this issue .As Indian female is heavier from waist so provide bottom also  of loose  fitting .Size chart is useless . Never the size and actual peace matches .

"

  Stitching is very poor and uneven.At someplaces stitch is wavy which is funny.Looks like bulk production of suit has lowered the quality.We buy ready to wear apperals to avoid visiting Masterji.Guess l have to visit one for getting in shape,if l plan to keep it just to avoid delivery boy bothering me.

"
"

  Material- moderate, not complete cottonPrice- since it’s kurta set, it’s value for moneyFitting- have to buy one size larger, bcz either arms can bcm tight or chest area if u go for exact sizeColour- is gud, like sea blue

"
"

  the size chart is messed up.. ordered L according to size chart , it didn't fit  replaced for XL size it was still a bit tight  however kept it as exchanging again n again is a hassle!!!Good Kurta set for daily wear though.. I bought a matching dupatta from Amazon to complete the set ..Got a matching mask as well :)I haven't washed the product yet so wondering if it shrank if it will fit me anymore?

"
"

  Bad quality product. When I ordered M is was good but a little small and when I ordered L the produce they gave me was extremely different and in a very bad condition, it was used product and the neck was different. It was made different entiry. I don't recommend to buy from here again. Or if you do specify you need the original product

"
"

  I got the product delivered on time. I have read almost all the reviews before i ordered this.However i felt disappointed after got the delivery. Bcoz color is bit dull and im afraid after few washes it may go very dull. Also as it is explained, its not pure cotton. It has synthetic mixed.So  think twice before order.Pros: I have ordered XL and it fits perfectly and its true to your size.

"
"

  I bought this for my mother as a Diwali present. The kurta reached her 1 day before the expected delivery date-amidst the pandemic. I bought her one size larger than what she usually wears, and it fit her well. The quality of the cloth is impressive. My mom mentioned that it didn't shrink after washing, and retained the colour. If you are looking for something trendy, comfortable and would last the grunt of daily usage, this kurta is for you.

"
"

  The kurti looks great.The material is soft.But the palazzo material is bit transparent. Also the palazzo I received was a bit stained.But overall a good buy for rs 575.I have not washed the dress yet...so dont know how it will turn out after washing.

"
"

  I have asked for a product return as the quality of the product is bad. It's over a week now but the product has not been collected back.  How will I get my refund

"
"

  The dress had correct fit, comfortable and quality of material was also good. As you can see in the picture, they have provided a matching mask as well which was not in the product description. We need to appreciate our Indian businesses and these nice gestures. The product was totally worth the money and I would highly recommend it. I am going to buy more from this brand and seller. Thank you.

"
"

  I bought this for my mother. Stuff is nice, comfy & reasonable. I bought 2xl in which kurta size is correct but bottom is too tight. Not even able to sit so had to return & this is the largest size they have. Otherwise stuff is nice. Colour is soothing & a matching mask comes with it.

"
"

  The Mrp is mentioned as 2200 which is the greatest joke after seeing the quality. They hv discounted the price  nd purchase price is 500, which is worth. The  quality and design as per price is good. But customers shouldn't be fooled by these discounts.

"
"

  Nice quality and stitches.Price: 573 rs ( Great Indian Festival sale)Seller: Cloudtail

"
"

  Very good fabric quality. Fit as expected you. Color combination and design is awesome..nice product

"
"

  If you are good at stitching, can go for it (470 rs me aaya kya h? Only reason). Bought it one size larger. But I needed to stitch it again .. for size and for stitching quality is so poor.Colour -not sky to blue, it is sea green. Pink colour leaks.  Not so bright ,but paired with pink dupatta (rani pink) so looks pretty cool and classy.Comfort- extremely comfortable👍.Stitching quality-very poor👎Size - true to its size.Sheerness- no;  solid colour.Material -pure cotton and comfortable too.I wore it 5-6 times , now can't use anymore, because of colour leaking. Pink paint and golden paint will fade away. Golden & pink  didn't affect, but green colour affected it most.

"
"

  The Fabric is fine. I wouldn't call the lower a palazzo. It has a really weird stitch and is quite uncomfortable especially on the thighs.The kurta is fine. The color and prints are good too but the palazzo/pant was a major disappointment.Just in case someone is wondering the specifics - i ordered a XXL size. I weigh 85 kgs, height is 5'5. Not the best choice for people on the plus side.

"
"

  Real quick delivery by Amazon.A very beautiful dress.. and amazing comfort and fitting. Plus cotton being my favourite I loved it right away.The Color is not blue but turquoise (greenish) so if you’re planning to buy it because it’s blue. Think again. However I would recommend you do because it’s quite decent and elegant at this price.Also, I got a mask and extra buttons with it which is really cherry on cake.And the disclaimer mentioned on the pack would make me want to buy more from this brand.Haven’t washed it yet so don’t know if the Colors are runny or no.. but I’d say for longetivity it’s better to dry clean it

"
"

  awesome product in such price.100% pure cotton, if u want to buy pure cotton dress set its a perfect product in such a low price, i will recommend u to buy without any 2nd thought.

"
"

  Nice colour but the material is day to day cotton and so the price we pay at the sale is the actual price for the piece. Though it says large, I would suggest you go in for one size largervtgan your actual size since its quite tight even before washing.Also, it came in with a most unpleasant smell and had to be aired out for 2 days before the smell went. Lockdown woes???

"
"

  Firstly, I have ordered a xl kurthi set.. The kurti,bottom looked good but the kurti was little tight on waist,bottom and mask were good .. So I have ordered xxl but when I received the xxl kurti set.. The kurti was comfortable but the bottom was too tight and small cloth on bottom onwhich size will be mentioned was  was cut .. The mask was also too small.. Very disappointed..

"
"

  1. Good for casual summer outings or office wear.2. The material does shrink a bit after wash but for me it was more of perfect fit after shrinking.3. I found the trousers to be a bit more flary. Would get it altered.4. The colour is subtle and beautiful. And with the right accessories we can bring out the best in this outfit.Overall a pretty good purchase at this price ✌️

"
"

  Fitting and stitching are smart but it's not of pure cotton fabric... Fabric is blended cotton... can't wear in proper summers of Delhi NCR at all... will be fine in pleasant weather of September/ October...Seller should mention this information about fabric clearly in description...

"
"

  I have ordered size xxL n they sent me XL ..  size is big issue .  In their size  chartXL is 42"" bust. U can see the pic attached with it . It is 42 ""with tight measurement. If any body size is bigger. Don't go for it.

"
"

  Absolute value for money. The material is a bit stiff. Feels like a cotton polyester mix. The stiffness did not go after washing,but it's not uncomfortable. Always go for one size larger,otherwise it will be tight. It's a total steal for this prize! Really liked it. The bottom is a cigarette pant and not a palazzo.

"
"

  product material is very poor..i have ordered for S size means 36"" bust but i have got 32"" bust in product size which was not even acceptable..fabric quality is very low & thinthis is not acceptable from Amazon as I tust Amazonbut it's a kind of cheating when seller shows something else & sends something else..seller should be honest in the terms of quality & size of productseller is just befooling the people.in the time of pandamic when people are not able to go outside & shop so we trust these sellers to get good productsbut they are just waisting your time & money.worthless product.

"
"

  Love it 🥰Paisa vasul..... Good product 👍.Comfortable, good quality, perfect size..

"
"

  It proved out to be very good for me 🙂 I got this for my mom and the pic attached here is post wash .. so I m more confident since it dint change at all post wash also.My mom loved it !! It very good fabric , good fit and colourful comfortable wear. Please go ahead and buy without any doubt ... Its worth the money 😍

"
"

  Firstly, the dress is good quality cloth and is a nice sober colour, however, the trouser is not a great fit for the top, it's tight at the waist for the size given and it's also short at the ankles in a way it looks like you're wearing someone else's bottom. And the design of the bottom wear is not that good, it takes away the look from the pretty top.

"
"

  Kurta is beautiful, well fitted and soothing colour wise. Pants are ill made. They are neither palazzo nor pants, as the elastic area goes way above your waist and somewhat loose. I am just using the kurta without its bottom. Have another matching leggings.

"
"

  The style is good, however there was a small damage in the kurta. I did not opt to return though since I wanted it for a particular occasion and it would not serve the purpose if i returned. The material is not 100% cotton. All in all a great buy for the price! Thank u Amazon

"
"

  I liked the material,  and stitch of the product. I always use XL in BIBA and hence I ordered XXL in GOSRIKI. But it did not fit me. I guess it is not even XL size. But I would have got another one if they had a bigger size than 2XL

"
"

  My perfect fit is a M but I orderd a L as some materials shrink on washing. It fits me very well!! Not loose not tight breathable and comfortable. The material is a little thick of that to cotton but it’s worth it!

"
"

  Actually it's not even worth one star. But can't write the review without that. It's a wrong sized item. It's fit is wrong. Don't fall fr the good reviews.

"
"

  Brought for my mom and she in love with itPure cotton fabricColour fastBeautful print kurta and pantAmazing fit

"
"

  Look wise very beautiful but only after 1st wear button came out trouser torn in just a single wear...........Conclusion is that this is a single use product.........Want to suggest other people don't go for this......After 1st use it will become useless.

"
"

  Go sirki provides pure cotton material at such a cheaper price I am amazed. The colour  (sky blue) is very sweet and It fits perfectly to me....the stitching quality and finishing is also very good.

"
"

  This is an amazing dress. Nicely designed with a nice, simple yet trendy neck style, long slit and quarter sleeves. The plazo is also well in shape. As for as fabric is concerned. It's good quality cotton, quite comfortable and soft. Colour quality is quite good, colour doesn't faint during wash. Over all I will give it 5 star as it is worth the price.

"
"

  Though it looked and fitted well, now i know is it so cheap. The quality of this suit is very bad, it doesn't softens even a bit after wash and stays stiff, feels so plastic type. I don't like the feel of this cloth on my skin, never encountered such stiff ever. I don't know what material is this, but definitely not cotton as I always prefer cotton over anything.

"
"

  The dress is awesome, I just loved it, it's pure cotton so that makes it very comfortable to wear, also looks elegant. Good for office wear, traveling and simple get-togethers.

"
"

  I purchased this only because it mentioned cotton. However the material is very hard. Even after multiple washes it's hard. A regular cotton kurta tends to be soft but this seems like a different material. Not too comfortable to wear.

"
"

  The material is not cotton and feels cheap, but I had expected that considering the price. However what bugged me was the sizing. The label showed size L, but in reality it was size S. So I couldn't even exchange as I wasn't sure the seller would give the correct size. I returned the product.

"
"

  The product is good.. but I returned it coz it has light gold glistening all over … that yellow shade with the flower shown in the product page image is actually a shiny golden paint… and i dont like that.. i bought it as a at home use…..but its not such casual type for my taste… so returned

"
"

  Ordered XL size which is two sizes more than my fit just to have a loose fit. Top is fine, but the pant stiching is very average, both Inline and thighs are very tight.. Returning it..

"
"

  I ordered two sizes s and L.Both have problems.I wear m size . Here as per reviews i ordered L sizeIn L size stuff was very good lower fits perfectly but kurta was too lose like xl .I ordered s size then kurta fitting was perfect but stuff was too poor not cotton something heavy stuff not soft . And lower was too tight seems like to wear for kids.

"
"

  Nice kurti set , everyone can buy this in this budget top is long with 3/4 sleeves , will be coming with mask and one plazoo pant in the image it is not plazoo I have already it and I made straight pant as per my comfort you can go with this product I give 5/5 for this outfit ❤️

"
"

  Product is not same as shown on Amazon page/image. It has no golden print on it. Please refer image attached. But colour of dress is very fresh and it's made of pure cotton. So, it's very comfortable. Moreover "" Gosriki"" Brand name is missing on dress and just size is written on it. Seems the product is not from Gosriki.

"
"

  Happy with my purchase. Luckily had ordered xl one size bigger,after reading reviews and it really helper top is with comfortable fitting (neck should have a option of buttons so if someone likes bigger neck can keep few buttons open) for one size bigger top the bottom is quite big hence can be altered easily. Material is not 100/-cotton but comfortable 👍

"
"

  I mostly prefer cotton dresses and as i like this is very comfortable with good cotton material. I like this dress its fitting is simply good,.there is no doubt in puchasing dress from Gosirki ,its a popular brand.

"
"

  The xxl is so tight ..even though it should be around 42-44 inch rangeBottoms are line size s or m.. and kurta is also very tight..chest shoulders as well..waist..complete

"
"

  Overall the quality of the product is good in an affordable price first I ordered xl size which fits me  but as per the reviews it was mentioned that it will shrink I ordered XXL size which was bigger for me but then I altered the dress and it's pretty much ready to wear and also I got a mask when I ordered XXL size. Thanks😊

"
"

  I ordered 's' size because as per size chart it's 36 inch,but my actual size is 34.but it's felt too tight.and also kurta material is not good as expected.and there is no price tag or company name tag in kurta.the just pasted price details in the cover  only.

   IDK who is checking the products before selling it, so I m gonna blame Amazon for this.They are literally selling garbage 🗑Indian Amazon is garbage.The product is torn terribly.

"
"

  I had ordered for L size, but the bottom size I got was S size (top size was L). There was no replacement option, so returned it. The product quality and colour was ok.

"
"

  Kurti size is perfect unlike pant which is too large for me. Overall quality of the product is good with such a reasonable price

"
"

  It’s a gift . Product colour as in picture.. fabric us pure cotton it’s starched should get soft after a wash . Got it at an awesome price . It also has a matching face mask with it . I feel for people with larger size;  order one size up .

"
"

  Simply Loved the stitch and cloth quality. Colors are exactly as shown in the Product Image. Only downside is that, the Pajama size (height) is less. I have ordered Medium size (considering that it's gonna shrink after wash) but Pajama is short even for M size.--------------------------UPDATE AFTER USING IT FOR TWO WEEKSExtremely poor quality . Yarn is withering off. गोले  आने  लगे  है !

"
"

  Quality just ok not that much so soft .some What soft quality. This is not pure cotton something mixed cotton. I ordered medium size it fit perfect for kurti.Pant hip size is too tight.

"
"

  Pants pattern is total wrong, that's why it's wouldn't fit to anyone. I spent half day to alternate it. Checked fabric is not matching, 10 cm shift. Fabric is not 100%  cotton, its should be 50% cotton or less, 50% polyester or more. The print and the colour are nice. But if you can't do the alteration on the pants - don't buy

"
"

  Before it's look like cotton only .After 1 wash dress looks old and cloth is not Cotton.. it's polyester.. don't buy.. gosriki products are very worst.. we are committed to buy that products bcoz of price..they kept very less prices and sending worst dresses.. don't believe them..

"
"

  Everything is good about this product except the fitting. I wear L size for all the known brands.However,this one is a bit tight for me.

"
"

  just go for it.. nice colour, material as well very nice . order one size bigger as it's material is cotton it will definately shrink

"
"

  Amazing product. Better than picture as shown.. Pure cotton.. Only 499..They have gifted me a kurta's matching mask.. Thank u amazon. A genuine product..

"
"

  I loved the dress.The fabric is 100% cotton. Very comfortable to wear & excellent for daily wear. I got it for 448. In this price it was excellent deal.Only point is its better to buy a size bigger than usual for a comfortable fit.

"
"

  Quality of the cloth is as per price (bought it for Rs 449)... average. Not yet washed. Kurta fitting is perfect but for pants it's waste  you can't even sit on chair (have ordered xxl) it's too tight.

"
"

  When arrived for the first time... quality was good pure cotton...but had to exchange it due to size issue....the replacement product was exactly same colour but the material was very bad...not cotton

"
"

  I like this dress bcoz of d beautiful color combination its jst same as shown in picture and quality s also gud but for short height the length of kurta s bit long so i made to altr dis but otherwise its gud choiCe @this low price thanku gosiriki and thanku amazon

"
"

  Colour- Loved it.Material- Not cotton, at first touch it feels like real cotton but after washing the same it turns out to be synthetic.Price- OkayFitting- Would suggest to buy 1 size larger than your normal size

"
"

  Though the size tag on the product is XXL,but after measuring and confirming it came out as XL,by mistake instead of XL,XXL size is pasted on the product

"
"

  Cotton, fits perfectly and as mentioned in description, loved itOnly draw back they show a pocket in Palazzo which was not thereYou can wear it will a plain pink dupatta to give a extra Grace

"
"

  Neither the material nor the stich is good...looks good in first view ..even in first view the threads were hanging but after 1-2 wear ,stitches came out...the stichers were large and hence were not durable...even the material is not good...

"
"

  Color combination goodKurta is standard sizePlazzo is small as per mentioned sizeQuality is good

"
"

  It was smaller thn the size we expected...I called XXL for mother in law but it doesn't fit her ... then i kept for myself...No doubt i material is good print and everything is good but i will suggest u to take one size bigger of wht actually u have ... Also exciting thing is they sent a mask which is not mentioned here so i was very happy for  tht..

"
"

  The colour faded in first wear only due to sweating without even one wash.I wore it yesterday and after few minutes of sweating the pink colour bleeded all over the kurti and plazo Ridiculous.

"
"

  First I ordered M size and exchanged it for L size. But again I got M size with some amendments in the same Previous M size kurta . Also the new kurta does nt hv the correct alignment of front button stripe because they make changes with the old Piece . Very disappointed and won't suggest to purchase this .

"
"

  Perfect fit. Value for money. Cotton. Nice print. In summer, it will be comfortable. Sober colour and print.

"
"

  Product is good.  Material is also good but size is the problem.  They have one standard size.  I ordered XXL and received L.  Even though the tag says it is XXl but as per the measurements it was large only.

"
"

  I ordered XXL but got XL size, The stitching seemed defective. The material was not really of some quality. Its not worth even for home wear. Pls dont fall for the photo & even the description given.

  Pyjama is utter waste, manufactures made it for a name sake as its not even fit for a child. The cloth is ok. Top's stitching also ok. But pyjama is a tragedy.Hello manufactures, be honest with customers.. Otherwise you will end up losing your buisiness..

"
"

  Looking same as shown in picture. Fabric is also good.  The Design Pattern is same as i need....Lil bit color is light...

"
"

  Good product.. But pant length is small., That's why deducting a star. Please take care of that. Otherwise good material and even they gave a matching mask with it. I m over all happy customer.

"
"

  Brilliant for the price.This picture was taken soon after the I got the product…don’t know if the color will fade off after wash though.Material is good and the color combo is excellent.

"
"

  Nice looking, good stitching, comfortable but not pure cotton,good lengthBut order two size larger otherwise it will not fit .normaly I wear large size but when I order large size it was not fit with me then I exchnge and order xxl it is pefectly fit ,  after it remain exactly look same like before wash

"
"

  Fabric is not cotton,as mentioned pure cotton. Don't mislead by writing pure cotton.Size of plazzo is good...kurta is loose.No doubt stitching is good.Fast colour.

"
"

  It’s a good product . Colour is exact same as shown in the picture , comfortable . Fabric of plazzo and kurta is pure cotton  . Loving it . It’s absolutely a value of money

"
"

  Bought XXL got two sizes small even though its wrotten XXL on its tag..dunno what game they are playing

"
"

  Pant is the same color as the top..not seperate as shown in the pic..and the material is thick and good..fits well..well.tailored...color is different from photos...flowers have a small golden foil print detailing on them...overall nice...after wearing out for a few times cud be used as pajamas also..

"
"

  The kurta is lovely for everyday useThe cloth is not soft it is kinda rough cloth with kadi type.I thought it will get better if i wash but noStill its pretty so ok

"
"

  This is not a cotton material. Very much disappointed. Pant is tight. Saw lot of negative reviews. Still went ahead and booked it and later felt the reviews were accurate. Not worth the money. I won’t recommend.

"
"

  Material is quite good...doesn't shrink after wash. Colour is good. Comfortable for daily use.Overall suit is good. But size is not so perfect it's bit small

"
"

  Quality of product is really poor that I had no option but to return the product... because I really liked the colour n design but unfortunately that would survive only 2-3 wash.. according to the price it's fine but better invest little more n have better  quality

"
"

  Recived in morning itself, packing was not good for material I feel somebody return and the just wrap up sent me..mask is missing.. about product quality of fabric is good its cotton with this price its worth, about colour and fitting I ordered S its fit me. Colour is same as shown.

"
"

  Kurta size and pant size don't match in any size options. Feels like they don't want us to wear/use the pant and the whole price is for the kurta only which too doesn't have quality of that price. Felt like cheated. Not going for GoSriKi again

"
"

  A perfect fit. The Best Buy till date. Must buy product. It’s material is good, pure cotton. Super comfort and looks elegant. It can be worn both for office and casual purpose.

"
"

  I am totally in love with this product 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 don't hesitate to purchase just go for it yeah I loved it very very very very much ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ and after washing its colour also not get fade Iska colour bhi Nahi Jaya 😋😋🤗🍫🍫🍫🍫🥰❤️❤️❤️

"
"

  Very good product. The fabric is excellent. The color does not go away when washed. The quality of the fabric after washing was the same. It was the correct fit. No need to shape again. It can also be used in hot weather. Very good.

"
"

  I have gifted this to my mom. After her experience with the item. The quality is okay. Design and colour is attarctive. Recommended to people who are looking for daily wear at resonable price.

"
"

  Those who want to buy cotton materialPlz don't go for itTrust it's not worth it...After the first wash cloth has small Knott type balls making it look like oldAfter second wash the colour faded away even if I dried it in sunshade

"
"

  It's just like some1 got some waste cloths from the outlet and they made it to a kurti. It is not shaped, the paints wernt filled. Jst the clr looks better

"
"

  One of my fav dresses bought online....material is good..doesn't deteriorate quality after wash..looks fantastic ...i wish there was matching duppata ...its hard to find a matching duppata...otherwise i am satisfied with product

"
"

  The seller gave a matching mask which was a very cute surprise we didn't expect. However the image shown is a light colour whereas we have received a dark green colour.

"
"

  Cloth is good and everyone likes who saw it. Thanks for good thing.

"
"

  Kurta is good. But its not pure cotton. Usually I buy xl, but ordered xxl n its comfortable.

"
"

  Good quality as expected,, though I read all review before purchase and as xs fits me so I ordered s and voila,,it fits me well,,if you wanna order this then go for one size bigger,,I recommend this if you want a regular comfi summerware,,

"
"

  The fabric quality ain't that great but not bad .. it looks decent enough to be worn to work. I love the colour and I would not say no to buying this if u have it in mind!

"
"

  Quality is awesome. The cloth is very  soft. so many times I wash and use still is not fade.it's little bit tight for me. So I think don't go to accurate size and go to next size.

"
"

  Ordered this product for wife, comfort and fit is good, but material is not cotton,its mix material.... little disappointed with that,look is as shown in picture, fair enough for price.

"
"

  I used to buy XS in other brands but I ordered S and it fitted perfectly. So go for one size bigger. This kurti is good to wear in home and it value for the price. The issues I found was1. Colour is little darker2. Buttons are very badly stitched so can't wear it outside home.I haven't washed it so I don't know how it looks after washing.

"
"

  This product arrived as shown in the image. Quick delivery and excellent quality. Best fitting ever I have received from online shopping. If you would like to gift your sister or mother or any lady, go for it. It's worth the price. Loved it.

"
"

  I just loved the product.. Definitely a must buy... Good product in that price range, good quality good size fit and looks elegant for office use as well as for a simple occasion.. Can be paired with a pair of simple wedges.. Thankyou amazon❤️

"
"

  beautiful  set as per price. if you want to order pls order the next size in comparison to the global size as the size mentioned runs 1 size  small than the global size like if you wantto buy size m buy l  and s buy m and thereon. no issue with stich. material is cotton and print is ok.

"
"

  We ordered 2 sets of the same type! One fitted me properly & I am using it! The set ordered for my daughter was too small & tight! Hence we r returning it! Kindly refund the amount of 1 set to our A/c! Tks

"
"

  Hello from USA. I Ordered this in India and got it here in US. I’m so happy with the product. The material is really good and soft. The fit is perfect and it looks very elegant. Go for it, its gorgeous. Please order one size large. My chest size is 40, but I have ordered 42 and it fits perfectly. The quality and the fit is wonderful. Loved it💝❤️

"
"

  The fit of the the dress is good. Especially the top is good for women/girls of height above 5""3 as it's long. For short girls this top might be little long. But the pant height is too small. Overall the material quality is good. It's good option for officewear/casual wear.

   The quality is good. It’s cotton. I got it for 400 bucks with the pant. Order your size. The size is fit. Pants are also comfortable. Overall a good buy for this price in a set. Also got a mask matching the dress.

"
"

  Nice fabric, nice pastel teal and pink colors, good for the price. The stitching can be improved a bit with better shape and fit. But overall the dress is quite good and very reasonably priced.

  Worst material, stitches are coming out in one use, shrinked after a single wash, you must opt for two sizes larger than ur actual size, below average product, not worth buying

"
"

  The stitching is of very poor quality, the pants tore in a single wear, the thread quality seems to be horrible. Despite the pants to be of proper size, the pants tore during sitting.

"
"

  Fit is perfect. Looks great and the product is just as shown in the images. The only concern is what if it shrinks after first wash.

"
"

  This was a valued purchase. Wasn't so sure about the quality in this price but it is totally amazing. The fit is perfect, the thickness is nice and it is same as shown in picture.Just hoping it doesn't fade away after a wash.Great bargain though!

"
"

  Height 5'2, weight 58 kg . Ordered medium size .top fit perfectly but bottom was too tight . So better to order one size bigger

"
"

  My become super bad quality of fabric after 1wash..also there is some stiching pattern mistake..as the slit of the kurta are not alinged..as mentioned it cotton but my kurta is not the cotton one

"
"

  My mom just loved this kurti that smile on her face makes me happy thank amazon for such a beautiful product.😍🥰

"
"

  Looks good. Perfect fit. Received a mask with the package.  Haven't washed yet so not sure if it will shrinks but overall it's a nice kurta

"
"

  This could be a better one only if its pant fits well.size of kurta is perfect according to your size but the pant is little tight on thighs, even if you go for the right size..

"
"

  GOOD , BUT FITTING IS VERY TIGHTGOOD , BUT FITTING IS VERY TIGHTGOOD , BUT FITTING IS VERY TIGHTGOOD , BUT FITTING IS VERY TIGHT

"
"

  This meterial is just too bad quality and pant will never fit u coz stich very nerrow u can't even put ur leg full inside .. I bought n I returned it .. i read many bad reviews still I gave a chance n bought that was my mistake ...don't buy girls

"
"

  It is not Cotton fabric,but I had to keep it as I washed as soon as I received so that it should become soft and wearable.but fabric is not skin friendly.

"
"

  In love with this , Super super super perfect size, great quality and received with mask, thanks a ton for the lovely product

"
"

  Dress which I receive is of totally different colour,  it is of dark green colour. Material is also not good. So returned back.

"
"

  Go for one size large for comfort, Double stiching required post 1st wash.Received matching Face Mask Thank You.

"
"

  In 1st wash itself the colour of the pant has faded drastically also the pink colour bleeds. Not worth the money paid.

"
"

  Dress is good according to the price..salwar is ankle length which I didn't want. Cloth is a bit stiff not soft, it might get soft after few washes. kurta sleeves are bit loose.  But overall a good product for daily use.

"
"

  The item is of good quality, I ordered this kurta as previous was too fit in size. One day delivery experience. A beautiful cloth mask is provided with previous order (2XL size), and on exchanging product, mask was not provided. Seller should make sure next time as this would gain popularity among females.

"
"

  Material is just wow at this price range. Pure cotton and plazzo looks super comfortable. Print and color of this kurta set is just same as shown in the picture. Thank you amazon ☺️

"
"

  Buy carefully as it says cotton but after onw wash although material remains same to look at but comfort level is nothing.

"
"

  Its worth money product....material Is very soft and fabric is good ...colour also looks very good while wearing ....can definitely buy this set.

"
"

  This is not cotton at all though it was mentioned in the product. Thinking, there was lot of starch in the material, I washed it. Now, neither can I use it nor return it. The material is thick and most uncomfortable. Also , the  fit is not good. Full money wasted.

"
"

  Perfect in size... Product is very comfortable and material is good quality... Same as shown in the picture firstly fits with the size... 😊 Product is valued for the money.

"
"

  Very comfy and good material... nice dress.. as expected.. very happy to get complementary mask of the same style.. thank you..

"
"

  Not good ..... colour got fade away in one wash .....don't waste spending money on it... fitting also not good

"
"

  It’s bleeding colour in every wash and bubbles in just one wash ... please don’t go for this product... very bad

"
"

  I ordered this for my niece as her birthday gift........  The material is good comfortable cotton.....design as shown in pics .........its a worth sure buy at this price..  👌

"
"

  Nice material considering price range.Cotton and good fit, came same as pictureMom appreciated it.

"
"

  GoSriKi Women's Cotton Straight Kurta with Checkered Trousers Excellent and good quality clothe material. Thanks for Amazon ☺️🥳

"
"

  1.same as shown in the pics2. Material is worst not feels like cotton at all eve ln after wash...much cheap... It's fly like a feather so you can imagine.3.botton is in between kurti pant and PalazzoAt local shops any one can get a good product at this price more way better than this

"
"

  Look wise ok.. but when you touch and feel the material it was disgusting material was rough and very stiff.. I don't know what happens if I wash..

"
"

  The material is good for summer. But the cloth faded after few washes. The bottom is tight as per the size.

"
"

  When i was thinking abt to order this i was little worried abt the product but the stuff is good and soft .... Also it is in budget... And more they give us a Matching mask thx Amazon.

"
"

  Fit is good, comfortable to wear, not a soft cotton, sort of rigid cotton, but not transparent...overall value purchase

"
"

  মাইকিলে বুলি কিনিছিলো, পিন্ধা পিছত ইমানেই ধুনীয়া লাগিছে, এতিয়া ৩ টা মান পাগল হৈছে । মোৰ কি হব ভাবিছোঁ । 🤔🤔🤔

"
"

  Nice product as expected.A cotton suit which is very comfortable to wear .You have to buy dupatta separately.The color is same like as given in the picture.You can buy it it's worth to buy.

"
"

  Good product in this price.v good cotton and looks smart.v good for daily wear in this price with a plazzo

"
"

  Product is not cotton. U could not wear it in summer. Material is not cotton and irritates in summer. Palazzo is not fit to size .

"
"

  Nice one. Comfortable and value for money. But always order one size extra. I order medium I other seller but in this large or extra large is ok

"
"

  The dress  material is too thick, and the color is completely different shade than what shown in the pic...

   A Decent kurthi for Home makers , Perfect for outing , My size xl but not body fit little alternation I will do , but fits perfect around shoulders and chest area , neck pattern is good , 3/4 sleeve , alteration possible , only hand wash .I recommend .

"
"

  Average quality cotton fabric. Quality of stitching is good. Size/fitting of Kurta is also good. But lower (palazzo/pant) was very small in size. On my request it has been changed by the seller.

"
"

  Fabric quality is too low not good as shown in the picture. And it is mixed fabric. I don't know how ppl are liking this dress I have seen all the review then I purchased this dress but it has no quality pathetic pls don't buy rather than buying from here I would have buy it from street vendor.

"
"

  I got a replica of the original with cheap stitchings n fittings.. cloth is also too dull...returned the item...

"
"

  Tight fitting on chest. Otherwise okay

"
"

  Full comfort, total value for money, perfect fit for me (L) and girls don't think too much just go for it. You will love it.

"
"

  Tops fits the size but bottom is tight. So it’s better to prefer the next size of what we actually wear.

"
"

  The product is excellent,comfortable and fit to size. The quality of the material is excellent also.

"
"

  Its same as in the pictures, size (xxl) fit perfectly to my mother. Quality is good, and its worth the money. Getting kurta with pants in such reasonable price

"
"

  Looks beautiful. Comes with a matching mask. Stitch is bad. Opened up around the shoulder even before use. Had to stich again before wearing.

"
"

  Can't comment about fabric as yet to wash. But order 2 size bigger as its randomly sized and is too small for its size.

"
"

  There was too much starch whn product was delivered but gradually washing took starch away which is normal but all the grace and shine was lost too.  The prints faded, cloth fitting went super loose

"
"

  Overall it's a good item that's worth the money. Only complaint I have is that the stitching is sloppy with the stitch on the edge of the material causing it to open up after 2 washes, thus needing re-stitching at certain places.

"
"

  Ordered two sets,one small size and the other XXL.. Happy with the small size as I got the same one.. But disappointed for the other as we got some other dress instead of this!Overall good product .. love it!

"
"

  This beautiful kurta set at 499/- is just amazing deal.Material, colour, pattern, print, style and stick evething is perfect. Order one size bigger. Go for it without any second thought.

"
"

  Lovely colour and comfy fabric... Quality is very good... Would love to buy GoSriki products in future

"
"

  Comfortable dress. Value for money. If color is somewhat dull. That's why I have given 4 star. Otherwise everything is very good.

"
"

  Had to exchange it but stupid delivery guy said it's not matching with my  product picture. I tried to explain him that's half of the Amazon product pictures are morphed😆 for instance this product has one picture with Soha Ali khan so did she photo shoot for this

"
"

  Kurti is beautiful and comfortable but pant is so uncomfortable. It is not possible to sit wearing that paint.

"
"

  Color has spread to all my other clothes as well... All the stiched have come out..worst quality 6

"
"

  Its exactly as shown in the picture size fits perfectly looks are good and rich overall good buy

"
"

  I bought it for my mom and she liked it very much....Very good quality kurti....fit is awesome as if stitched with measurements....nice colour ....does not shrink nor fade....I recommend buying this....

"
"

  Material is not very good.. colour is way deeper.. also label says free matching mask that was not given

"
"

  There's a slight colour mis-match in the kurta pallazo..expect 2 shades deeper than the picture shown..

"
"

  Colors and pattern look beautiful.Value for money.Fitting is comfortable

"
"

  Kurta is really good and comfortable, but size is a bit smaller. Had to replace to bigger size.

"
"

  Beautiful Kurti and very comfortable to wear and the best part is u get a mask with it from the same fabric

"
"

  Indeed a beautiful Kurta Set. The fabric is quite good. The fit is good. Got a free mask too. No complaints as for now. One can definitely go ahead with this.

"
"

  The quality of the fabric is very poor, I feel very sad after taking it, I did not expect that I would get such a poor product from Amazon.

"
"

  Color, fitting, comfirt, all perfect... Good purchase an affordable price. Must buy. Especially for summers, weightless suit.

"
"

  Product has slightly dark colour compared to the picture shown here. But it is very comfortable. Cloth material is good.Delivered on time. Packing was good.

"
"

  Very good product. Cheap prize. It is made of Cotton. got ordered colour and size. received in time.

"
"

  I actually ordered L but I was delivered XL but to my surprise it fitted well. So better order a size bigger than ur usual size. Otherwise it is jus as good as is shown in the picture

"
"

  Material quality, colour overall is really good. Pant I found a bit uncomfortable and not the perfect size as per the kurta.

"
"

  Kurti fitting is good but pant is too tight, colour is different than what it shows i e., on dull side.There is a hole in the chest area but still if the pant fits well i would still keep it..

"
"

  Kurta is fitted but plazo is very tight. I am not happy with plazo. I ordered double XL size but  I think plazo is not a double XL is too small for me but kurta is totally comfortable am happy with kurta not plazo .

"
"

  Perfect material very much comfortable and fits the size as mentioned in the description.... Worth buying! Nice summer wear collection

"
"

  Doesn't feel the comfort shape and even smell of pure cotton...not even feel like mixed cotton..it's completely rayon

"
"

  Excellent product!!! At this cost the dress is way too much good in normal store this would cost around 1k . They also gave mask free that was cherry on the cake ❤️ Super satisfied

"
"

  Worth every penny, got it for 599 only . Good material, fits perfectly . I am in size xxl. Loved it.

"
"

  I had issue with the size. The Kurti fits me perfect but he lower was tight. So returned.

"
"

  My wife simply loved the set. In her words  ""Marvelous tailoring for perfect fit. The cloth is pure cotton. Good that we didnt have to buy material separately and getting stitched adding the tailor expenses. Very good at this price. ""Thanks!

"
"

  Ty Amazon ...the product quality is good purely cotton fabric...... comfort 👍but yes u should order one size bigger item

"
"

  Though it's nice product , pant is not even fit for small size given 3stars only for kurta

"
"

  Cloth is kind of ok, might get shrink after the wash. For me it was on loose side , so didn't like the fitting so much.Kind of ok in summer & daily wear

"
"

  Ye must buy product hai ,100% cotton so comfortable aur wash karne ke baad colour bhi nhi gaya .Ye mujhe rs 450 something mila hai. Aur saath me 2 extra button aur maching mask bhi hai . Is price me to material bhi stich nhi hota hai . I sooooooo happy 😘 thankyou Amazon 🙏

"
"

  Don't by this. Its qualiity is pathetic. Smells dirty. After wash it become 50 percent.

"
"

  I ordered my size, but it was small in fit. I ordered same size for all my clothing but this dress was not good and fit in size. Kurta material is not good after one wash it will not be good material.

"
"

  The overall look of the set is really good. The fabric was little papery when got it. It’s not very soft material. Haven’t tried after wash yet. The fit was comfortable.

"
"

  Super, I like very much. Same picture colour, Cotton material , Correct fit but little bit long size , Correct date delivery and value for money. Go for it.You will love the stuff and comfort. Also, the quality of material as well.

"
"

  Some to same as I see in the picture and comfortable as the colour is so nice. I am very very happy.

"
"

  It's nice..i ordered L size and is is perfect feet for me...cloth also nice..not thin ..overall it is nice... product. ...go for it...

"
"

  Kurta  material was soft (before wash), but trouser was missing. I returned it. It has a nice green colour as in pic

"
"

  The fabric quality n fit is ok but the color is too dull n looks like faded n old. Not worth.

"
"

  The print is very dedicate n soothing but the size is very small. Exchanging it for bigger size

"
"

  Not a good fabric......Saying cotton but it's not....... colour is completely different from the display picture

"
"

  I wasn’t expecting too much . But I was pleasantly surprised to receive this set. It’s beautiful. The material is good.. fits well.. I m hoping the color won’t bleed after wash.. All in all a great buy for the price I paid. Hey, and it also includes a mask.

"
"

  Hiked price with massive discount  absolutely cheatingNot worth of Money .. be careful with such  Brand .

"
"

  Product is superb at this price range...i got it under 500..colour and pattern is same as shown ,don't know how it will be after wash.

"
"

  Nice set at this price it fits exactly and quality is also nice I am reviewing after wash no color fade or shrink, bust buy product

"
"

  Worth the money , good quality cotton, pretty color and design. Runs a bit small and would suggest going one size up

"
"

  When I selected the item and put it in the cart.... at that time the price of item shown is Rs 469 but when I done payment at that time price shown is Rs 499

"
"

  Value for money... correct fit... stylish..not cotton ..but comfortable...can be a travel attire...

"
"

  Size is too small. Should order 1 or 2 size larger than your usual size.  I ordered for L size and got M size pant with L size kurta. Both were tight. So returning it. But overall product quality is good. Only have problem in size.

"
"

  It's exactly what I was thought and its very good and size also perfact...I like this may be I will buy extra...

"
"

  Great for price, didn't fade after wash, feels truly comfortable, cotton fabric, was delivered within 15h too.

"
"

  Quality is low and stitching is not standard, I know at this price or 500rs expecting high is not correct but I suggest don’t put such low price if the quality is not maintained.

"
"

  The dress is of a very low quality. The dress has torn at many places. Better not to buy it

"
"

  This is the best purchase I have done on amazon yet.. fitting was a bit loose bt its fine..good colour and material.

"
"

  Not pure cotton. Did not like texture of the material. Top fits correctly, bottom not so correctly.Okay product. Reasonable price for the quality offered.

"
"

  Very good dress, pure cotton, may shrink a bit, bottom length very low, top is too good

"
"

  I loved the product. Color, fabric everything is perfect. I bought XXL for my mother but the trouser is bit tight along the thighs so i am going to order a bigger size whenever it's available. Great product. Will look beautiful on everyone for sure!

"
"

  This product looks prettier than the picture .Let’s see how it looks after first wash

"
"

  It was perfect @lookwise.....it does look great on a Fair skin tone....the color, fit was excellent...may be they can be a lil better on quality of the apparel......however it will not disappoint you I believe....

"
"

  Nice piece.  Looked exactly as it is in the picture. But size was too small for me. I ordered XL. It is almost same size as Small for South Indian women (Not girls 😀) i wanted to exchange for a 3XL. But not available.

"
"

  Slightly fitted for S. Take one size up when in doubt. It's nice 🙂 professional and simple

"
"

  Superb quality and fits perfectly. The comfort is good. The color is amazing.

"
"

  The meterial of the kurta is ok. Not that as I expected. The size is accurate. The nice part is I got a matching mask. Which is very cute.

"
"

  The fitting is good. Gives a soothing look. But the cloth is not cotton. It's somewhat polycotton. Not comfortable during summer

"
"

  The quality of the product is ok, good enough. It is a bit rough but hoping the material might soften after a wash & hope the colours will not fade away. Fit is good. Pant is a bit too fit for me.

"
"

  Material and colour is good..... little doubt about print on kurta, after wash will go or not.... other than this everything thing is good....

"
"

  Okay product according to the price, leaves pink colour after wash, and will find nots after washing.

"
"

  The quality of the material is not good at all..after wash it became too stiff to wear

"
"

  It is thick cotton stuff..... After wash it looks very dull l don't like.....

"

   Material is not  that good and after one wash color is fading I was totally disappointed . Color was dark when it arrived but after wash it became dull . Pattern is same as shown in the picture  of the dress.

"
"

  Product was delivered very promptly although packaging and item was in bad shape. In addition mask was missing from suit. In all excellent job by Amazon but the product vendor should work kn packaging and missing items.

"
"

  For delivery 5/5For material 4/5For fit for size 5/5For stitching 4/5The printing is ok ok ....my main issue is i orderd M size but got s ...and rest is good and satisfied at this price

"
"

  First time I bought clothing from Amazon for myself. This was a perfect one. Value for the money too

"
"

  Overall i liked the product. Totally non transparent. Colour is as shown in the picture. Material feels little bit starchy. I am 5.2” & size S, i had to alter the kurta length. 👍🏻

"
"

  Not so good. Fabric is not cotton ..it's mix. N it shrinked after wash. Thank god I purchased one size bigger  . Fitting also isn't that great. .

"

   Ordinary!!! not a classic buy

"
"

  After wash , no shrink, no color lose. Same as before wash. I am happy.

"
"

  Very disappointed with this product...product got dull and faded after first wash...wastage of money to buy this...please amazon dont buy this type of local stuff...didnot like it.

"
"

  Best quality in so less price , it's pure cotton.. my wife loved it.. rich look

"
"

  The cloth quality, stitching and colour is nice, but is slightly smaller than the tagged size. I am ordering an up size for me.

"
"

  I had expected the colour as in the image but I got teal green. I'm awfully disappointed. I'm not returning it only as my mother liked it.

"
"

  Looks good.  Fabric  slightly hard and stiff. Not much comfortable. The bottomwear is too tight.....a little more flare would have made it more comfortable.

"
"

  The quality is ok but the sizing is not upto mark. The print is good. Returned it

"
"

  Good for daily wear during Summer. The best part is the matching mask they provide.

"
"

  Good quality product according to the price. Worth buying.  Fitting was awesome I order one size bigger as compared to my size. I also got the matching mask and I really loved it

"
"

  Sleeves weren't the same as shown in pic..also quality of the material esp bottom wear poor..was torn after hardly wearing for two to three times...size was smaller than expected

"
"

  The cloth is not  cotton  but some mix like polyester. Not for summers.

"
"

  Top is good. Size is as expected. But pant is very very small. Totally unfit.

"
"

  Comfortable to wear. Simple and elegant. No damages. Excellent dress

"
"

  Very well satisfied...as good as expected...worth the priceTry to buy one size more...since the pants can be little bit tight...when the top is perfectly fit...

"
"

  The Kurta is XL size. It is comfortable and good. But the trouser is not XL size.It is too small for XL size. I had ordered XL size for other trousers and those fit me comfortably. You should correct the size of the trouser.

"
"

  It's ok for the prize...but very disappointed as it's polyester blind one ...don't buy if you are particular of cotton for the summer... Stitching is just ok

"
"

  In this price it's superb...pure cotton... lovely color but do no go with size chart...order usually u wear size...

"
"

  Worth the money. The cloth doesnt seem like 100% cotton . But has wearing comfort. The pant stitching and fit is good.Worth buy and good option for college/office wear 👍

"
"

  Kurta and pant palazo set is good. Fabric is fine and price is also reasonable. But pant palazo should be large as kurti is okk but pant is little bit tight. But overall product is good and you must buy.

"
"

  Good at a price of 478.Comfortable and good for causal wear.Color is different from picture

"
"

  So horrible delivery. Top one size, bottom one size. Bon returning same thing delivered with size label plucked. So horrible and disgusting.

"
"

  Every thing good but got hole in palazzo so plz check the product and give other wise eveything is good value for money fit is good

"
"

  This is not at all cotton dress, don't go with the description and images. After first wash colour have gone and bobbling  came

"
"

  I couldn't try the product immediately. But then when I tried it turned out to be too small. I had ordered my usual size. Complete wastage of money. Couldn't even return it. Very disappointed

"
"

  Fabric-cotton, which is great in summers.Light weight kurti set. Nice colour with decent print. Size is little bit large. But overall I like it.

"
"

  It's very good. Cloth, size, fitting everything is perfect. Go for it.  I loved it

"
"

  Nice dress at this price range. I bought it at Rs 459. Material is pure cotton and dress is comfortable. My mother is very happy with this gift.

"
"

  Quality is not up to the mark. I am very disappointed with this productI suggest do not buy it i am returning this

"
"

  Top got torn after one wash... Pant is tight... Go for a one extra size....its an OK product

"
"

  nice product,very good.

"
"

  nice material and look good too good product in this price range

"
"

  Comfortable, quality is good for the price and the fitting is absolutely fine.

"
"

  observed drop stitches immediately after first wash (holes or missed stitches that appear randomly in the fabrics).Hence comfortable and will use cause can't return now but can't recommend.

"
"

  I just love kurta the fit the style everything is good but I just hate the bottom it is too tight on my waist and looks like a pajama rather a straight pant. overall a good purchase in this prize I must say.

"
"

  Very nice n comfortable ...good  for summers affordable price...

"
"

  Decent and comfortable.Liked it for its material and design

"
"

  Fabric is good and breathableBut bottom is tight. As I ordered XL size but still bottom is tight n there is no margin to loose it.So, 50-50 about the product.

"
"

  Colour fades just in one wash. I could wear this only for twice.

"
"

  Very comfortable, fitting is perfect...👌👌Awesome fabric,looks classy... value for money 💰🤑💰🤑

"
"

  It is very cheap quality product. When it was delivered it was very different from it's discription. When I was buying it it was written 100% pure cotton but when I purchased it was not cotton. When I washed it it became very transparent.So, please don't buy this product...

"
"

  Same as display, perfect fitting, nice quality, very comfortable and good looking, good overall, doesn't bleed colour, doesn't shrink.

"
"

  It is good for daily use. Worth the money. Not pure cotton but seems almost 90% cotton cloth is uaed. Looks good.

"
"

  All ok at this price.. for short girls it’s a bit lengthy.. can adjust it anyway

"
"

  Gud productQuality is excellent ☺️ in this priceLoved it

"
"

  Super quality expecialy cloth is very nice and good every one must buy.price also low and worthy product

"
"

  Product is worth the prize as what else you can expect at 400 rupees cloth is also comfy but the main prblm is that it shrink so i would advise to buy a big size . Otherwise the product worth a try beautiful elegant and worth the prize

"
"

  I like the material it's so gud to wear...got the dress as expected but size was a bit longer than expected.... As it's a cotton material I think it'll shrink.... I'll recommend to get this product without any hesitation....

"
"

  Purchased this for my mother.She is very happy with the product quality & it has fitted her well as per the size we were looking for her.

"
"

  Cloth is pure cotton. Loved it .Buy it for summer off course.kurta set is awesome

"
"

  It's good...but colour is not exactly like picture which shown here it's quite dull colour not fresh one...and cloth Material is quite rough than usual ...and also I don't get mask which shown in picture

"
"

  Very good for the price, got the mask also along with suite

"
"

  Nice quality n print at this cost... Just for information the size u order should be one size bigger than ur actual one.

"
"

  Perfect fit and looks great 👍 color is slightly dark than the shown but looks nice

"
"

  Perfect suit set ...i get a mask with this suit....go for it...get it for just rupees 469.....

"
"

  Perfect fit, good color contrast.. didn't look a dress worth only 5oo, definitely worth the money

"
"

  I like you product ,,comfortable,,, very very nice product

"
"

  I liked it, value for money, I got it for 499 rs. Did not wash till now.. Looks same as in the picture

"
"

  I choose the size M. Its perfect for me.. and fabric is good.. but its not too good.. palazzo nd kurti is very comfort to wear.... its cotton fabric.. colour is almost similar to exact picture.. overall its a good one.. i recommend for daily wear for ladies nd girls..

"
"

  Awesome..I bought it just Rs. 499. Not pure cotton..but value for money

"
"

  Kurti is right fit n length I just loved it bt 1star less coz d pant is very short in length for me I m 6.7may b coz of my height

"
"

  Good Product, Value for Money, Nice Material, Perfect Fit

"
"

  Arm length is discomfortable..because it is exact upto elbow....it should be a little longer or shorter than elbow....because at this length of the arm, elbow can not be bend freely...I want to return this product for this reason....otherwise it is good....

"

  The stiches came out only after one wash from the Palazzo. The kurta is fine. But the quality of the cloth of the Palazzo is poor. Prone to get torn

"
"

  This product is excellentl.I love this very much. Buy it again for myself.

"
"

  Kurty is absolutely ok but issue with plazo bcose its large size as per kurty, other than that everything is perfect.

"
"

  This one is super awesome, simple yet stylish as in looks sophisticated!! Value for money!

"
"

  Quality is not that much good, not pure cotton, fitting is oky need to do fitting (size brought XL)One more thing, one can easily compair with the provided mask and kurta set have differen colours

"
"

  It was a pleasant surprise, the quality and fit  at the price purchased.

"
"

  Product is good. I got a damaged one. No provision for exchange. Wanted to exchange. Had to go for a refund. Visible damage in the weave about 3 inches long, right on the sleeve. Everything else OK.. Disappointed.

"
"

  Material very light  ok ok was expected mask but nt received

"
"

  Even though my fitted size is L still order XXL for comfort.... But the bottom is too small . I feel they have sent small bottom. Also there was no mention of size tag on bottom.

"
"

  The material is not cotton. It has chanderi kind of texture and is always very hard and wrinkled. But given the price for a set it is good

"
"

  One of my best purchase from Amazon.......i got almost 100/- rupees off and 100/- cashback with this....at this price the product quality and colour everything is more than what i expect

"
"

  Bought by my wife. This is her review. Nice set at great price but size is small so had to return it

"
"

  Kurti is very loose at stomach.Tags were not affixed anywhere on the product or packet.

   The original color of suit is sea green not blueFabric is ok for daily useWorth of cost

"
"

  First I bought Medium size. Pant was really tight. So I had to go for large size. It would be good if they add a tie knot in the pant. Other than waist issues, it's a good quality product with nice colour.

"
"

  Liked the dress in size and fitting. Good to have kurta and pant in affordable price.

"
"

  Good

"
"

  Stiches in the trouser are extremely poor. When I was trying to wear this for a trial, the trouser's stiches got loosen and the same came out from the source. Same thing happened various places of the trouser.

"
"

  Just wow...pure cotton material...colour is little bit darker than the image.....if u r busty girl go for a size larger than yours.

"
"

  Excellent product for summer wear. You have to make adjustments to fit perfectly

"
"

  Liked the product, Mask was a pleasant surprise. But lot of it's  print color got wiped off in first wash.After using it, its print color vanishing in simple handwash.

"
"

  I love the fabric as well as fitness..Excellent for the price..

"
"

  I have received the torn kurti. Also, the quality of kurti is very poor. After one wash it will become very transparent. I have ordered yesterday and immediately applied for refund.

"
"

  Comfort and very gud quality at this price..479/-rs only..

"
"

  Comfortable and value for money.

"
"

  Quality is good. This is the second time I ordered, but the colour is more of green shade rather than blue. ... Last time it was fresh blue.

"
"

  Nice fitting, color, texture in a very reasonable price of 600. No second thoughts for buying it just go for it.

"
"

  Don't buy from this seller. Quality of material ia very poor. Colour and print does not match with picture. Worst quality and transparent . Definately not worth more than 400

"
"

  Good quality.... Colour is slightly dark ......but its more prettier than picture

"
"

  Everything is good in this product but Amazon size chart is not according to the product. I ordered XXL which shows 44inches width of the product but in real it is xl size 42 inches instead of XXL. So I recommend always order 1 size larger.

"
"

  You should buy this item as this is so good kurti and the material of cloth is also good.. colour is amazing and the price is also in a good range

"
"

  I ordered 2 XL size but they had delivered XL size which is little bit loose to me 🥺 overall material and look is too good but please Amazon be careful towards size and material.

"
"

  The fit was too good and the product is as advertised which is the first criteria to buy online. Satisfied with the product

"
"

  Its not pure cotton.. Its cotton blend.. Bt price wise its good  to purchase.. 👌🙂

"
"

  Checked pant is missing in the package. Why? When it is clearly showing in the display or mentioned that it is a paired product . Please try to check the items before you deliver it to the customers. Very disappointing

"
"

  Product is average overall.. but salwar is too short for tall ladies. If ur height is 5.2"" then it's ok.  Otherwise don't purchase.

"
"

  Too much miss match in size of kurtas with bottom. buy XL size then pant will fit ok but require alterations for kurta with L size.

"
"

  Product as per description and good. Fitting is good ,thereby design as per standards.

"
"

  Stritching and material was good.. go for next size to actual measurements

"
"

  Cloth material is good.Design is good but there's small damage on the backside of kurti.But disappointed.Please check for damage or default before sending out the parcel

"
"

  Overall the product was average. With different colour

"
"

  Super happy...bought it for my mom and it fits perfectly

"
"

  Fitting is not comfortable as on neck side its loose little bit falling.

"
"

  Stitching  is very bad ..not satisfied  with the product..have to go to the tailor for double Stitching...

"
"

  Lookwise Good. But It is not 100% cotton. Color didn't fade after 3 washes. Pant height is short. Overall good.

"
"

  LOVELY KURTA , FITTING IS NICE, SUPERBBUT MASK NOT SAND😌, Buy thay sand many other customers..?

"
"

  looks goodshould have more color options

"
"

  After 2 washes the color is wasted...price is cheap  and product is very bad

"
"

  Nice product. In this price segment I got best product.

"
"

  I have brought Xxl for my mother in law although from myntra we used to brought L for her but still your xxl size is very tight for her

"
"

  I loved this product, comfortable material,pure soft cotten after one wash ,prints and color just amazing suits in every shade.Most importantly I got same color mask inside the package 👍😊go for it

"
"

  Very comfortable. Nice cotton  kurta set. Meterial is good. Fitting good... I love this kurta set very much. Totally value for money. In this price this kurta set is too good.

"
"

  Kurti Top is Awesome, but pant have very delicate stitches

"
"

  I got the bottom and kurti xl size. Fitted properly.  Material is not pure cotton but blended. It is stiff as of now. Let us see after wash price is in budget. But as promised face mask is not delivered along with.

"
"

  Colour is not same as the picture, it's kil darker. But overall nice, for casual wear.

"
"

  Cheap budget friendly. But quality not up to the mark. Colour is entirely different and darker from what is shown

"
"

  The material is very soft and comfortable. Simple and smart look. Good for regular wear. Only problem is it will shrink after first wash so go for one size bigger than usual.

"
"

  The quality of material is very good and is very comfortable.

"
"

  Please don't buy this.The moment I opened the package, it stinks to the core. Smells extremely fishy. Don't even want to touch the kurta.

"
"

  Can buy for daily use. Fabric is not pure cotton. It's somewhat mix fabric. But ok for daily wear.

"
"

  Clothes quality, color and fittings all is good at this prize. I loved it👌

"
"

  The quality of Cloth is good as per the price. And received a free and matching fabric mask with it. Absolutely loved it. 👌👍

"
"

  The cloth is very thin cotton and quality is not worth the price

"
"

  I gifted to my sister. She wears large size but this is a bit tight. Otherwise material and colour is nice.

"
"

  Good Quality and better than it was in pic

"
"

  All over it is very good and comfortable daily wear but please go for one size larger as it is cotton cloth it might get shrinked in future after wash so better to have a safe zone I even received with mask 😍😍

"
"

  Pant of this suit is so so ..... Tight . means you can't sit while wearing thisAasan of pant is so so..... SmallWaste of moneyAnd cloth of suit is not cotton as written in description

"
"

  A dress is very comfortable and quality wise product is also good, its a cotton fabric and i like it, I received mask with the dress which not mention here, overall I like this dress

"
"

  Quality not pure cotton, little rough, could have being better.

"
"

  Good Material. Colour is brighter than shown in the app

"
"

  Good fittings... Beautiful... Good price,

"
"

  It was awesome I m very satisfied, fabric was good

   The kurta is good.. however I did not recieve the pants with the order though it's mentioned on the page that the kurta comes with checked pants

"
"

  very comfy. i was never so happy before shop dress online. in this price they provide design/ varity /Quality/ comfert.i just want to shop 3 _4 more pair from GOSRIKi brand.don't think just buy it.

"
"

  It is meant to be gift for someone but very sorry to tell the folding was horrible inside out it was like taken out of a 'ghada. ' quality seems to be ok

"
"

  Although fabric is cotton but fitting is too bad it is just a straight kurta with no fitting at all take any size either will be too tight on chest or too tight on waist.

"
"

  I got perfect kurti in low budget... Thxu amazon.

"
"

  It's definitely worth to buy this dress at this price.. The quality of material is very good and even the colour dint fade after few wash.. 100% genuine product.. Just loved it's colour and fitting.. Also got many compliments too.. ♥

"
"

  This product really appreciate nice comfort quality is good at this price. You should buy at least once.

"
"

  Value for money and come with matching mask too !

"
"

  I exchanged the product due to size issue but the finishing of exchanged product was bad and also the mask was missing. However with the first one we received a mask also. Now I m not getting exchange option.

"
"

  Comes with pants and a mask, very happy

"
"

  Top kurta fitted well. But bottom trouser is tears if we sit forcibly. Need to be careful on this.Overall product is good. Good to buy it.

"
"

  Overall good product. Very comfortable.

"
"

  Worst quality also torned . Not accepted this kind of issues . Seller should check product before dispatch . Amazon has to review product before supply to the customer .

"
"

  The quality is worst for the material dont buy it.Size of pant is different and size toh top is different.Don’t makes any sense in buying it.I returned it back.

"
"

  Good material, fit as expected and worth of cost

"
"

  Really loved the product ... fitted perfectly ... comfortable and exactly as shown in the picture .... fully satisfied ... thank you so much Amazon ... ❤❤❤

"
"

  It's trouser is too small, not comfortable. After wearing when people sit, it will tear outAfter washing this cloth set, it's starch will come out and it will become very very thin.

"
"

  Good quality material, colour and gold print does not go after wash. Value for money. Must buy.I bought one size bigger and that perfectly fits!!

"
"

  I like the product. आप सभी को एक बार ले कर देखना चाहिए, बहुत ही अच्छा और आरामदायक है, और सिम्पल बाहर आने जाने में आप पहन सकतीं हैं । रंग बिल्कुल नहीं जाता बल्कि धोने के बाद और भी सॉफ्ट ही जाता है।

   Cmfrt for summer nyc quality in this price superb bt clr is very light compare to pic after all gud product thnk u amaz👍👍 kurti is lengthy little bit

"
"

  The quality of material is so good, it's soothing cotton. Regarding size, I felt that the pant was so tight, hence had to alter it. Overall the outfit is so good.. comfortable and classy.

"
"

  The product is good. The cotton quality is awesome

"
"

  The fit, the colour and everything about the kurta is amazing. A must buy kurta for sure

"
"

  Value for money.But it's not cotton

"
"

  Quality is good in manner of price, buy a size larger than your normal size because I wear the size 'M' but I had to exchange and I ordered xl ..otherwise the product is fantastic.. I got a matching mask also ..😊

"
"

  I ordered size Xs and got this in 480,and was a bit unsure beforebuying,but it is a very good product in this sum of money,I got many compliments,go for it 💯💕

"
"

  I bought it for my wife... The quality of the cloth z horrible. Not worthy.... Only design is good... Really thin cloth.... Dissapointed

"
"

  Fabric and colors are nice. They have sent a mask along. Thanks for that.Trouser fit is not ok.

"
"

  Buy one size bigger.as it's cotton.. its little tight compared to rayon

"
"

  Poor material quality, does not match as shown. Not recommended.

"
"

  very comfortable.good quality dress.Perfect fit.

"
"

  Below average... Color was darker... Poor quality cheap material.. Mrp blindly youl put 2600/-its not worth 500 too... Please mind what u see... Don't fool people.. That's what direct buying is better...

"
"

  Returned ... material not good, not cotton and fitting also not good

"
"

  I found this kurta set amazing. Quality of fabric was also good.

"
"

  Very comfortable to wear, pure cotton, reasonable price. Matching mask too... What else needed for ₹500? You can buy this without second thought. Good buy. Worth every penny

"
"

  color is different from shown picture,,,,plazo length is small,,,i ordered L size,,,,not satisfied

"
"

  Nice one but  only fitting issue .

"
"

  pefect fitting..i ordered s size it fits me perfect but its a pure cotton after wash it has not shrinked that much so u cna select Your actual size.editing treview after using of 1 month

"
"

  Kurti plazo set perfect  both fit as except ed Thank u Amazon value for  money daily official use product.

"
"

  I liked the comfort n fitting of the product except that the colour got faded after the very first wash...... specially the trouser. Disappointed with the colour leaching.

"
"

  The color in the image and actually are totally differentFabric is not cottonIts like polyester..Dont buyNot worth for money paidDisappointed

"
"

  Nice colour and perfect fit. I thought material may not be as smooth but to my surprise it is very comfortable to wear. Color is bright then shown but looks good.

"
"

  Average quality but pant stiching is very bad & comfort

"
"

  Product is good in reasonable price. Exact same as in the pics and comfortable too.

"
"

  Everything is good but the trouser size is small.

"
"

  Comfortable cloth.Lovely colour 🥰You may go for it. ❤👍🏻Thanks Amazon 🥰

"
"

  Quality of the material is soft and nice. The stitch is a single stitch and needs another round of stitch so that it doesn't open. But Loved the color and the feel of it.

"
"

  bottom elastic is too tight and it’s not comfortable to sit n do the works also color fades when we wash.Not Happy . Kurta is fitting is okay kind

"
"

  Quality of the material is just ok.Fit is alright, you can buy better from other brands at same price.

"
"

  I like the product quality colour and fitting with mask. I loved it.Must buy this product its worth it. at low cost u will get nice product.

"
"

  If I had -star policy I could have given thatThirst class materialWorst fittingNo specification of measurement

"
"

  Kurta is good, but plazzo is bit small.. Plz  go siri make plazzo large in size, length wise.. Thank you 😍

"
"

  Good for summer use make you feel light

"
"

  You get for what you paid. Fabric too weak, worn out after few days. Don't go outside wearing it, there are good chances, you may see few others wearing the same outfit.

"
"

  Pure cotton n very comfortable don't think just go for it...

"
"

  Really nice dress and worth for the price... material is really good n fitting is perfect..if ur size is xs go for s..fits perfectly. For my height the top is little lengthy..but u think it's fine.

"
"

  nice look. Very comfortable and looks as it is shown in pic.

"
"

  There is no price tag with kurti..why?

"
"

  I just loved this kurta set 😍.. Its beautiful m fits so well and additionally I've got a mask of same material... 🥰Thank U 🤗

"
"

  I like this product because of its colour and design. Its value for money. And my wife also liked it.

"
"

  Well yes it is good ofcourse in this prize..she liked it.. quality of material is quite doubtful ..I really don't know what it would be after wash .. otherwise yes it is Nice ..True size

"
"

  Good material, but it was fitting very much so had to return and get one size bigger for comfort and was also scared of shrinking issue.

"
"

  Quality is superb, the pattern is also good, but I have an issue with sizing purposes. I ordered size 2XL but I received XL size which is so tight. This is a huge mistake from your side.

"
"

  I like it. But not wash till now. So don't know after wash what happened

"
"

  Please provide size chart correctly...fitting is not proper...

"
"

  I bought size ""m"" but kurti being too fitted exchanged for size ""l""..interestingly pant for ""m"" was loose and ""l"" is too tight...Also it is not a cotton...one !!

"
"

  Initially the size was an issue but I m happy that we got it exchanged immediately next day and the product arrived on time. Thank you so much for replacement

"
"

  The kurta is lovely. Did not like the pant though.

"
"

  Thin cloth but its cottonComfortable to waer, print iHope it will stay same after wash.

"
"

  Good quality product for the pricing they provided during diwali sales.

"
"

  Kurta is very nice but payjama is too small ...my height is 5'2"" n it fitted me as 3/4 like capri..so return this product

"
"

  Like1) Fitting is good2) comfort3) Good looking in newDislike1) Not Good Quality2) Blackish spot on cloth after one day use3) cloth stitch is weak

"
"

  Fabric is cotton. Comfortable to wear and elegant look.

"
"

  It's not cotton. I bought this kurta set for its cotton material. Please remove word cotton from dress which are not cotton.

"
"

  Product is awesomee!! Loved the color combination and straight kurti makes the magic to the outfit....Loved it... recommended to everyone...Just check the size chart carefully while taking :)

"
"

  Very good quality cotton kurtiVery comfortable and fit as expectedPure cotton kurti with good designValue for money, must buy

"
"

  Very pretty suit 🤩Fitting is nyc🥰Fabric very soft and color is soothing to the eye✌️

"
"

  Good for daily wear at this price point

"
"

  The cloth is good, ordered M, it is correct fit now, after wash if the cloth shrinks, it may be a problem.Generally if I buy M, I will shapen it.. so, compare to other brrand M size, this is smaller.

"
"

  Colour is darker than picture.good for daily use summers.

"
"

  I returned it one time as it was too small...then I reordered it, this time I ordered a bigger size but I think I got the exact same size as before...but it's ok...I'll take it for this time...

"
"

  Very nice product in this range. colour is not the same as shown in pic.... a little darker but looks very nice.

"
"

  I have ordered one more same kurti in 10th June, in that ordered one matching mask is given but I have reordered but no Mask is with the packaging.. otherwise at this prize good kurti

"
"

  Pants size is lil biit tight than average

"
"

  measurements for the bottom are not given. this has been my experience with similar products from other brands as well. have to wear some other matching bottoms. :(

"
"

  Item is good as expected but size s not correct, my usual size s xxl nd this is tight for me. After a wash if the material shrinks, thnU i think i can't Wear it

"
"

  I liked the product and for the price value it's really good

"
"

  The fit is right and the material is very good.

"
"

  Very nice .same as shown.No bleeding of colour.

"
"

  Excellent fit and perfect material at this price.

"
"

  Quality of cloth is not that great....it's ok ok...can say value for money 💰 had to double stitch the dress...

"
"

  Since april19 i put the return request of this product & given feedback too but nobody came for pickup yet. I need update on same.

"
"

  Product is differ from picture shown in advertisment beware when buying products online that u choos by impressed from picture and u get whatever the seller have actually. Colour and variety size are different

"
"

  Its  perfectly suits on me ,pretty look fabric n all over good, thanks Amazon for this simple and sober product

"
"

  one small defect found in the received product that unstiched back edges.. Since it is minor I decided not to return.. Apart from that I felt kurti is worth for money.. Can use for daily wear.

"
"

  It is good in all terms, but the color is not the same.

"
"

  Fabric and print is ok. But stitcing is not good. It's open  with 2 or 3 wash. Normally i wear  M size but in this brand i purchased Large size. Because M size is too tight

"
"

  Awesome 😊 dresses but colour is dark. Better to buy two size bigger than regular size

"
"

  Good quality comfortable clothes

"
"

  Kurta was as per siza but they would provide a same size plazo with elastic. Plazo would certainly fir your waist but it will be tight over thighs. Do not buy if you have large hips

"
"

  I liked it so much my wife is very happy after get this.

"
"

  Quality is ok ok..but problem in stitching.I ordered small size but it's tight so I exchanged with medium but this is used product so again I exchanged then I received medium size but this small n medium size is same

"
"

  Comfortable,nice, good fit, poor cotton, nice style, worth the cost

"
"

  There is colour mismatch to what is received and what's there on the app. Quality is good.

"
"

  Very bed and uncomfortable fabric,  cheap quality, model wearing round neck and delivered different neck I'm very disappointed.

"
"

  Very good for this price.

"
"

  Amazing clothAmazing fittingAmazing lookSame as it shown in picsPlease go for it guys best gift to give in diwaliThanks alot Amazon 😍😍

"
"

  It's not at all cotton. Returned it

"
"

  Delivery was fast, material was good but the stiching was horrible cz the cut on one side was front and on the other side it was back and not equal..

"
"

  Cloth quality is worthless. It will shrink after one wash. Don't waste ur money

"
"

  Product colour is good but quality of Cloth is low fitting as expected

"
"

  Size:S.good colour n fabric. Great for daily wear.

"
"

  Reducless product,,don't buy worthlessCheap materialI've to gave 1 star bec 0 is not available

"
"

  Am happy . Nice fabric quality is good worth it money

"
"

  Fabric is not cotton, so not for summer. Stitching also needs to be improved. It is just like 'kachi silai'. Shirt fitting is fine...plazzo is neither pant nor wide leg.

"
"

  Exact design and fitting

"
"

  The Palazzo is very short

"
"

  Print and colour are good and very eye soothing. Material is not cotton. It is more like a polyester mixed material. Pant is pencil patterned.

"
"

  It's comfortable but the quality of the fabric is very poor... If u give value to ur money btr not to buy this... The colour is completely different from the picture....

"
"

  Very nice.  Nice fabric, Comfort and prices.

"
"

  I did not got pants with the kurti very disappointed. I returned the kurt. And again buying it let's c this time of they r giving pants. Otherwise will again return n won't buy for sure.

"
"

  Product looks nice more than the pics....Quality is superb, stuff is gud. I am happy it such a great item in less price.

"
"

  Pattern and color is  same as pic, quality  is  not  that great  but according to  price  it's  worth for daily  use

"
"

  Product is good but size problem

"
"

  This is worst product...totle west of money h jyada se jyada ap 2 bar pehne apko samajh ajayga but dekhne m bohot achha h cloth quality bohot kharab h

"
"

  Recieved a darker shade and not as mentioned on the website. It completely lost its color just after one wash now it looks worse.  Very disappointing.

"
"

  Nothing to dislike about the product..it's very much pocket friendly nd product wise, material wise excellent too....Thanks...

"
"

  Pure cotton.. very comfortable in use....

"
"

  Horrible .. teared up just wearing for the first time. One of the Worst buy from Amazon

"
"

  Fabric is just👍Reasonable enough to get such good quality! Totally loved it!

"
"

  Stitching is very poor. All the stitches have come out only after wearing it once. So I would not recommend it.

"
"

  Colour fades after first wash..not pure cotton...

"
"

  The cloth quality is low and it has paint

"
"

  it's totally different,. even colour also different. it is vry dark not as shown there.. i'll not recommend

"
"

  Nice kurty ..comfortable and valuable

"
"

  It's is of good quality as per the price, looks and feels like 100% cotton

"
"

  I luv it please go for it the size ,material all is gud..

"
"

  Nice suit set pure cotton.. Good stuff.. Bought in 489 rs

"
"

  It's not cotton completely,  it's mixture of cotton and synthetic. Mostly synthetic. Wearing it feels very uncomfortable. Not appropriate for summer.

"
"

  Very nice kurta , material is good.  Liked  this  kurta 👍👍

"
"

  Size is not at all as mentioned . Stitching too is very poor

"
"

  💯% cotton Material value for money 💵 good quality of product

"
"

  Bought it for my wife. And it didn't lasted for a month. It was comfortable but quality of material was worst.

"
"

  I love the product. Colour, quality,  design everything. But i will have to return it because of size issue. XXL here is a size smaller than other brands. If there could be 1 size bigger, it would be perfect.

"
"

  According to the size chart this product fitting is not correct. It was very tight to me.but I cannot return it as I teared the tag.

"
"

  Dress is v good I really liked it but the tag says that the seller is providing matching mask with it which is missing. Otherwise I m happy with the product.

"
"

  Nice but not standard.

"
"

  Comfortable and good materialMust buy

"
"

  I brought this dress for my mom and she is really happy and feel very comfortable.The quality of the product is very nice and value for money thanks Amazon 🤗😆

"
"

  Stuff is awesome.. Perfect choice for summer 👍

"
"

  Very poor material... Color of the pant weny away withinn1-2 hours of wearing it... Stitching is also very poor.. Design fabric is fine but the quality is very cheap

"
"

  While the product claims to be cotton made but it is Polyester mix

"
"

  Design  is good  and the quality of the cloth is also good  it will  be more  better  if duppata  of the same color  or Design  is added  with the pant and kurta set

"
"

  Color goodFit goodLength is sufficient to alterFabric is good

"
"

  बहुत ही अच्छा सूट है।मन खुश हो गया। dilevery तो बहुत ही फास्ट है।धन्यवाद amazon

"
"

  Stitching is good...but quantity is very poor not cotton it's like polyster

"
"

  Not a cotton material.... Ok for home use only

"
"

  Size is right. Pure cotton. Colour is same as shown in the picture. You Must try it.

"
"

  This looks like a very poor quality direct rip off of Gerua product available in myntra. Amazon show check for these duplicate really bad quality products.

"
"

  Comfortable cotton kurti

"
"

  Superb and worth every penny....Good after wash also..

"
"

  Kurti is comfortable , pant is not . In that price smart buying . Can be team up with other pant/ palazzo .

"
"

  Thanks  Amazon. I love  it

"
"

  Low quality fabric

"
"

  Stitching is not good.But material is good

"
"

  Asked for xxl size.though the label says so the size is  m if compared to all other standard brands.it is absolutely useless for me. I am sure the cloth will shrink& will be still smaller.

"
"

  Stitching is not done properly and average product

"
"

  The product received was as shown in picture. The fit was perfect and comfortable. It is a great value for money.

  Price wise product is worth.Slightly change in color due to photography effects.Material is nt pure cotton it’s mixed.

"
"

  Large also dint fit...take two sizes more than urs :((((

"
"

  Don't buy this dress. Quality of the cloth was looking good before wash, in a single wash the color fade, and got torn in 2 washes, so overall not a good product.

"
"

  Quality of kurta is excellent.Pant is little bit less in quality than kurta but it's good at such a price.Comes with a matching mask.color is bit darker shade than shown in the pic.

"
"

  Material is not pure cotton... Synthetic mixed material, which made me sad.. Size is as mentioned..

"
"

  Top is in perfect fitBottom is small it's like large size

"
"

  Very good product

"
"

  Value for money. Nice color and print. And they gave mask also. So the whole set looks cool.  Although not washed yet, so don't know if color fades on wash.

"
"

  The prodcut is as shown in the image . Good quality and comfortable.material is thin  but as per rate its fine .

"
"

  Gifted this to my mom. She loved it. Since it has light foil print in it so I don't suggest wearing it daily, one can wear it when running some errands.

"
"

  Design I good.. Not quality

"
"

  Not a good product ,cheap quality and also give a duplicate product ,back of suit have some damage part.

"
"

  It is not cotton!

"
"

  Not recommendable,  quality is not durable.

"
"

  Excellent kurti with pant. Order usual size.. it is perfect for summers. Cotton stuff in summers is very soothing to eyes as well as for body.

"
"

  Kurtis is good fabric but measurement given in chart is not perfect ...so I'm returning but when I bought I paid 509 rs,and they giving me 469rs which is actually show...

"
"

  We usually pay this much for stitching only!Liked the potli button design and elegant look.

"
"

  The material is of low quality and not cotton. Wrong description given by the seller.

"
"

  I ordered xxl and recieved l which is way tooo right and small and so had to return .

"
"

  Kurta fits perfectly however trouser didn't fit at all.. otherwise product is good

"
"

  Awsoume , lovely, with out any doubt go for it

"
"

  The Stiching is very good thank you Amazon for this amazing dress.

"
"

  Like that product

"
"

  Cloth quality is not good, fitting is not good, cloth fabric is not good

"
"

  The product is just awesome but please make larger sizes, like 4xl and 5xl atleast. Those who are healthy can also feel the comfort.

"
"

  Superb quality

"
"

  Amazing Amazon love it.... It's very soft work with price I love this I referred to buy🥰

"
"

  Not made  in cotton material.  Stitch quality poor. Worth for around 450 rs. Cheating by mentioning discount.

"
"

  Faltu quality polyester material

"
"

  its not fit, looking good

"
"

  Good quality product.

"
"

  Fabric is of very low quality.

"
"

  One amazing buy

"
"

  Product is as shown in the image and perfectly fitted to me.Material is also very good.Looks so elegant as well as decent.

"
"

  I did not get the product as shown in picture. I have returned it because of different design and poor fabric but I did not get refund yet it’s been more than 3 weeks

"
"

  Beautiful 👌♥️

"
"

  It seems cheap but it's quality is cheaper. Fabric, stitching and size is not upto the quality. It's better to enhance your budget or go only for kurti at this price.

"
"

  Material is very cheap quality and pant size is too small for me, like kid's size,, that's why I returned it

"
"

  Amazing kurti set .. fabric is soo good .. fitting perfect and worth every single penny.

"
"

  Fabric is good n comfortable...only d buttons are not tucked in  straight line

"
"

  Please buy it. It is worth. Perfect as shown. Trust me you would not regert buying this. Perfect size (M) Also they have given mask of same material. Go work GoSIKRI

"
"

  Cloth quality is very poor

"
"

  Good quality material.

"
"

  Nyc dress, quality is not pure but good , comfortable.

"
"

  Nice product

"
"

  Ok type suit

"
"

  Didn't like the quality of the material and poor quality stitch and fitting. Not as shown in picture

"
"

  Color is different

"
"

  It's better in real! Go for it

"
"

  Good Product

"
"

  I purchased XL size but when I received the product it shows XL tag but if you measure according to standard making it happens to be L size so disappointed

"
"

  Nice and comfortable.

"
"

  Awesome product. Comfortable, quality of material also Awesome. Fiting also good.

"
"

  There's no option to do rate this poor stuff as stitching they made by hand itsee

"
"

  Not satisfied at all. The fabric is not cotton ,too hard even after washing.I bought it for summer but it is not at all ideal for summer.Although color and fit is as mentioned.

"
"

  I am really impress with the product quality and mask make me feel very happy 😍😍..Would prefer to buy gosirki products ..

"
"

  I bought for my niece and she loved it.

"
"

  No softness & no comfortable

"
"

  Product is very bad.cloth quality is polyester not rayon.

"
"

  Good one same as picture shown in the cart

"
"

  I bought the product after checking all the reviews. But the material is worst and colour is entirely different from what displayed here.

"
"

"
"

  Can't get such piece at such reasonable price.

"
"

  My kurti button is too small as a picture . And not sand me extra button.not send me Mask. I am very disappointed

"
"

  Quality wise good but the size was small

"
"

  Clothes is very soft, beautiful colors combination and comfortable...for me the length is little long but m very happy

"
"

  Very poor quality of cotton..

"
"

"
"

"
"

  Well it fits good but cloth is not pure cotton it a cheap cloth and stitching quality is pathetic specially bottom wear.

"
"

  Material was good...Size is too large than expected...So better to take small size.. Than urs

"
"

  Too Good.... Comfort,quality,softness, fitting all are good also price is lowI like it.....Color is as shown as pictureGuys u can buy it

"
"

  Meterial quality is as same as in picture.Confirt wise top is too good in size but the pant is very small in size.If you want only top then go for this product.

"
"

  Lovely lovely piece

"
"

  Bad fabric

"
"

  Best product at best cost..certainly liked suit a lot.. Fabric quality n color both are excellent at this cost!! I got free matching mask n buttons like toppings on cake 😊

"
"

  The product is average, I ordered xxl one size bigger than my size but again this product was so tight. And after one wash it would shrink further. Had go return it. Not satisfied

"
"

  Very....nice.... perfect fitting.....color also good

"
"

  Quality of material and fit is very good.product color is same as shown in the picture.Got it for rs 404 which is a great deal.

"
"

  After first use look at the material.. very bad quality.. I don't feel I will able to use this more then 2 times.. disappointed

"
"

  Cheap quality

"
"

  The product is really good..the material is pure cotton and it's not seen through..after wash also it's nice...The color is thick sky blue and pink not mint green as shown in the picture.

"
"

  Very good

"
"

  Bad quality

"
"

  Very good quality.but size is too small .and Amazon doesn't return my delivery charge.whereas it's not my fault, why don't you cheack proper size.

"
"

  THE COLOUR IS NOT BRIGHT  AS SHOWN IN THE  PICS, FABRIC QUALITY IS OK-OK, ORDER ONE SIZE PLUS, BUT THAT IS ALSO A LITTLE TIDE.

"
"

  The material used is of poor quality and the seller only shipped the kurti rather than the whole set.. completely dissatisfied

"
"

  Product is not good... During first wear only pant stitches came out. Material is not pure cotton as mentioned in product description.

"
"

  Kurti is too small for the size of L and it looks like it has been starched..Suit was not fresh and quality was very poor...felt like after one wash kurti material will fade..Too disappointed

"
"

  Its good , i don't know hows after wash but now quality wise good and same as picture , little pent size large other wise overall nice product for the daily wearing 👌👌👌👍😍😊

"
"

  Good Product 👍

"
"

  It's good in this price range but fabric is too thick and hard. Also sizes are not mentioned right, order 2 sizes up.

"
"

  Quality and price is too good

"
"

  Comfortable

"
"

  I bought this product. The material is nice but pant is too small. You can't even put your leg. If you size is s then buy xl or xxl. Worst product I have ever purchased.

"
"

  Awesome product in this price (500Rs) . Colour, fitting, material all good.

"
"

  This product is really awesome....same as shown in picture.....fabric is pure cotton.....worth for money......simply best......I bought this product for my mom and she really loved it....

"
"

  This product is quite decent at this price. Nice buy!!! Bought for Rs.500

   Threading is not proper. And cloth material is transparent. Third class material

"
"

  Don't like.. different colour and cheap material..........and when we return the product Amazon saving money in its own account not our.. Amazon play a game at that time with their costumers

"
"

  I have received kurti, but trouser is not included in the packet. Send me the trouser as soon as possible

"
"

  Like the quality of material and product fit as stated. Trusting virtual shopping is worthy when such good products delivered to customer...

"
"

  No mask in the packet.....

"
"

  According to price quality

"
"

  Good Quality

"
"

  The quality is awesome.

"
"

  Awesome kurti...Go for it . cotton fabric , lovely colour, same kurti delivered as shown in picture.

"
"

  Good summer option

"
"

  A good one for the price but the golden color is slightly fading after every wash

"
"

  Very inexpensive and a good one to buy. You won't find good clothes at this price online.  Comfortable, light and fit.

"
"

  Very comfortable and I like it thank you Amazon

"
"

  It fits well as given in the description. Material is bit thin and need to check after the wash if it becomes soggy . Ideal for summer use.

"
"

  I will just suggests  you all that only to take one size larger of your actual size...... otherwise the product quality os awsm ftngs and finish of the product is asm supr comfy.....

"
"

  Stich was not correct. Open hole found.ordered for M size but delivered  S size.

"
"

  Like for material dislike for stitching of pajama because it is tight when I set on  ground it tore on the joint .

"
"

  Good on

"
"

  Color not good

"
"

  Its too tight for me i ordered this suit in my size along with 3 other suits with same size 'L' but don't why only this suit particularly is tight.

  Small in size and quite not happy with fabricBut as per value worth it

"
"

"
"

  It's worth for buying.

"
"

  Material of the kurta is not good. Size of the product is not as per the standard. Kurta fitting is good but it's pant is small in size

"
"

  Awesome product, looks better than pic. Only problem with pant length, Lil bit short, still giving 5 🌟 for quality and looks.

"
"

  Good looking, and fitting

"
"

  It's fitting is good. I got what I wanted

"

  Suit was nice....but the neck of suit is too small and stitching is not good..... Over all according to the price its nice....

"
"

  It is really very comfortable to wear and has and awesome look

"
"

  Gd one.

"
"

  The suit fits absilutely fine and the material of the cloth is good too. Not much different from the one displayed in the photograph. The quality was satisfying.

"
"

  The pants are comparatively small and the fabric shrinks after washing

"
"

  It looks like a designer wear.It is looks elegant and smart.And is very comfortable

"
"

  Good quality

  👎

"
"

  Size is same .. Colour is ok not as bright as shown in pic......I think One should go one size up as it may shrink.. Plazoo is without string also

"
"

  Not the same as picture

"
"

  You can simply go for it

"
"

  Love this kurta and palazzo set it's very comfortable and good for daily use even for office dressing look thank you

"
"

  When I received the product for the first tym size was small in the packaging I had face mask also when I replaced with the other size I did not receive the mask .....

"
"

  The product  is not as the same size of what I ordered.  And there is no mention of the size it is not fitting  .But the quality of the  Kurta is good

"
"

  Stitching is not so much perfect. Quantity is too poor. Colour went after first wash. It's looking very dull now. Money is ok for middle class family.

"
"

  Quality is not good. Set looks very dull.

"
"

  Gud

"
"

  The colour is not shown as in pics .. it is little darker than the pic.

"
"

  Very nice product

"
"

"
"

  The fabric colour did not fade after first wash. Although fabric is not too thick, it does not look cheap and is comfortable to wear especially in summer.

"
"

  The dress is nice and fits well.A good purchase.

"
"

  The quality is worst so I returned it.

"
"

  Colour nd print is nice but cloth is not soft its not cotton as mentioned

"
"

"

  So happy to choose this product, it fits perfectly, colour is also same as the photo. Very comfortable and worth for money

"
"

  Quality is really good in this price. I like this product butt the only problem with this is fitting. Fitting  is bit disappointing for me because kurta is bit large.

"
"

  5 stars been given compared to its price. Color slightly washed out during the 1st wash. Then onwards its fine.

"
"

  Beautiful  fabric was pure cotton

"
"

  The product is as shown on amazon exactly the same. Meet the expectation. very satisfied with purchase.

"
"

  I like the product but eventually colour is too dark as in the picture it shows light blue and what I recieved is Dark Sea green which seems dull .

"
"

  It's nice one,but golden design not expected. I don't the golden colour go off or not.But very nice set.

"
"

  Shrinks after first wash. Go for 1 size bigger.

"
"

  Very nice qaulity material. It fits perfectly 👍👍

"
"

  I receive damage product,so i will return the product don't buy fabric is so cheap and transparent...

"
"

  Nothing to dislike in it,,so comfortable it isPure summer product

"
"

"
"

  Product was good.quality was good.value for money.but pant was short for 5.6 feet girl.

"
"

  ordinary..did not want to waste time on return

"
"

  It is not even worth of ₹500Total wastage of moneyCheap fabricTotally dissatisfied by the product!

"
"

  I loved it . It's a perfect fit .but I hope it doesn't shrink

"
"

  The product was awesome than I expected.It's more comfortable and the quality of the material also nice.The only suggestion is the pant colour was little bit darker

"
"

"
"

  The material is awesome and worth of price .Big thumps up who wants to buy it n the most suprising was I got a matching mask

"
"

  Nice kurti

"
"

  Kurta and pant quality is very good at affordable price. Best part is mask came along with kurta set. Highly Recommend this.

"
"

  Quality of the cloth is horrible.. size was too small..I returned as soon as i received and checked

"
"

  I really liked the product. Its correct fitting and the cloth is pure cotton.I purchased its based on the reviews and its not bad yet and feeling blissful

  Ok ok type product.. not so good not so bad... Quality is ok. Color and print is not up to mark. But comfortable for daily wear .

"
"

  The product is so transparent. Colour goes off after one wash. Quality is so poor. Wastage of money

"
"

  It's not cotton

"
"

  Material is ok kurta size is perfect but not happy with plazo size, it was not according.

"
"

  The kurti with plazzo looks great but size is an issue.Make sure you order 2 size up.

"
"

  amazing its very nice worth buy

"
"

  Color is as shown in picture..quality is good..at this price worth each penny

"
"

  Received the package today..looks so attractive. .but the stitches are of bad quality..so,got torn when I tried it.It was not at all tight for me.

"
"

  Pant print will be gone after 5-6 wash , but at this price you can purchase it

"
"

  I like the quality of product.looking elegant thanks to Gosriki, worth every penny  guys go for it thank you Amazon

"
"

  I like it .

"
"

  Really nice product ..fabric is not pure cotton its mixture..but okay

"
"

  The product of material is not good. And I receive the different item which is shown in amazon that is design & quality . so for this item my experience is worst.

"
"

  Kurthi is good but the Palazzo is smaller than the expected both in width n length

"
"

  Good quality, very comfortable...

  It's too great to wear and quality jus loved it won't and it won't bleed after a wash......

"
"

  Worth it.. best product in less price

"
"

  Not as expected. It’s not cotton. Kind of low quality material

"
"

  Product is ok....I didn't like the fact that it's not cotton but it's mention here in product description that it's pure cotton.

"
"

  Ok

"
"

  Ok product, The material seems it'll shrink after wash.

"
"

  Very good product. Cheap considering the price.

"
"

  The product is very good. It is comfortable and easy to wash. The best part is it's softness and wash and wear quality.

"
"

  Kurta looks good but on label it says they are providing masks but no mask delivered with kurta

"
"

  Every thing is perfect

"
"

  Superb 😍😍

"
"

  Uneven stitching of front seam line. Gets crooked. Need to straighten out each time. Disappointed.

"
"

  Must buy

"
"

  Nice product with bright colours

"
"

  Kurta is fitting ok but plazzo is too tight if I sit down with this it will tear. It should be loose on thighs

"
"

  Cool for summers 😚😚Ordered for my mum nd she loved this set

"
"

  Cloth is very nice, fitting is also nice but plazzo is little bit loose overall very nice product at this price range.

"
"

  Awwwwwsome.....Material and color came as expectedTook XL, though size is LSuggestion : Must take one sige bigger to be fit 😍

"
"

  Awesome product

"
"

  Good cotton clothe material for this price. I have bought it for ₹469/-. Color is not faded after wash. No shrinkage also. Correct fit.

"
"

  Colour fades just in 2 or 3 washes. Rather a person can wear it only For 2 - 3 times. After 2 to 3 washes even baggers don't accept it.

"
"

  Nice dress👌👌👌 Gud fit Good look overall beautiful dress by Amazon.Thanks 2 Amazon 👍👍👍👍Get 2 buy peoples....Hope u guys like it..

"
"

  Very good quality products for moneyVery surprised with the material after 2 time wash still the dress has the new shine

"
"

  Disappointed with the quality as it is synthetic not cotton at all

"
"

  It's very comfert and lovely kurtie set.. tq amazon

"
"

  Pants are too tight on waist. Not as per the size of kurta

"
"

  Good product..gives a smart look..

"
"

  Beautiful suit.. perfect fit and amazing quality

"
"

"
"

"
"

"
"

  green colour dress not shown color

"
"

  Good cotton fabric, good length, pretty colour. Just go for it. Worth buying.

"
"

  Its actually polycotton type.

"
"

  Looks good

"
"

  Colour is totally different.... Material is also not upto the mark.. bt kept it.. what else we can expect in 550 rs..

"
"

  Very poor quality, bubbling came just after 1st wash

"
"

  It is very nice nd perfectly fit on me.love this😍😘

"
"

  Don't buy from them their product are low quality they give a old one which one doesn't have any mask or tags , So please don't buy from them

"
"

  Very very bad. I just saw the ratings and purchased. But very disappointed. Returned now. Thanks to Amazon for easy return.

"
"

  Xcellent....go for it

"
"

  Material is cotton and soft. I like it

"
"

"
"

"
"

  Very reasonable price. Good quality and fiting is perfect

"
"

  A must buy, value for money, doesn't shrink and comfortable to wear.

"
"

"

"
"

"
"

"
"

  Good

"
"

  The colour of the suit doesn't match as shown in the image. It's completely different but the design is same. Fabric is also not so good according to price.

"
"

  It was a copy of a different product ie this is duplicate item

"
"

  Quality not cotton as mentioned. It seems like polister.

"
"

  Bad

"
"

  Quality is so bad. Dress has a stinking smell while opening itself. The quality is so poor. Will last for only a couple of washes.

"
"

  A good product  which is simple and dignified

"
"

  Too good than ecpected. Must buy product 👌

"
"

  I like the dress. But I want the colour of the dress should be little bit dark. My dress colour become faint after no. of washing.

  Good gift to daughter in telugu Shravan month on Shravan Friday with good wishes and blessings to her in life

  The print on this fabric is so pretty. I am literally in love with this banarsi print suit. The fabric of the suit and dupatta is so good. The floral printed dupatta looks so mesmerizing . Dupatta is heavily golden printed but its still very light. It is absolutely beautiful.

"
"

  This is super suit .It is unstitched material . colour and print ia also very nice , fabric is also good.

"
"

  Quality is good.Nice to useFabric is wowwColour combination is awesome

  So comfortable and good quality of cloth, even after so many washes cloth quality is so good

"
"

  I would say over all good product , the fabric print and quality is good the size is also FREE size as mentioned . Really a good product and my wife planning  to buy couple of more.

"
"

  Product is good.  Material is good. Quite comfortable and elegant. Just 2 issues color is discharged during washing, material is slightly thick.  Overall is a good purchase

"
"

  Overall product is very good. Needed a little altering but that's not a problem.

"
"

  The fabric is good and comfortable. Also suitable for hot summers. Fitting is preety good, although mine was a bit loose on the underarms but it made it far better for summers.

"
"

  I liked this product very much because no alterations needed. I can wear it at home as well as for going outside also. But no colour guarantee. Wash it separately.Just buy wash & wear guys.

"

  Good product, best product for best price

  The prints on the dresses were different from the ones shown in the image. The material is also a bit too thin and kind of transparent.

"
"

  The product only looks cute bcoz of the print otherwise it's extremely transparent, the quality is very low, definitely not worth the price. The material is also not cotton but a mix. Plus it's meant to be a free size but is still very short, more like the length of a kurti.

"
"

  Product material is very thin, although it is soft and switchable material.You need to wear more cloths under this one.Product is made in chinaCartoon pics on product is not at all matching to what is deliveredThey should display what they are sendingAlso options should be provided to select which color and design of product we want.

"
"

  Nothing like the picture. Don’t look picture n buy. Transperant material. Not free size. Amazon pls very n sell

"
"

  The nighties are made in a flimsy single jersey fabric. The nighties are transparent too. The stitches are poor and they are already bursting at the seams. They will not last more two machine washes. Use your discretion to buy this.

"
"

  It is written in the product description that the shirts are knee length but actually it is not even mid thigh length. This when I am only 5 feet 4 inches in height. The material of the shirts is too thin

"
"

  The material is not cotton but some synthetic which is uncomfortable to wear in summer and humid weather. So keep away. Item is incorrectly categorized in the description.

"
"

  I don't wear it. Never bought anything like this in my life. Wastage of money. Add says these are cotton materials, but not any sign of cotton. Made of some synthetic thread which makes skin feel itchy. Yikes.......chee......

"
"

  Shorter than shown in pics. Material is good and very comfortable to wear.But if you're above 5 feet tall then it will be really short for you.

"
"

  It looked very pretty. Loved the colour... But the material was too thin... 2 layers of the fabric was still see-through...You can read a book through it...

"
"

  The product does not have the Quality expected for the price, The material is so thin and stitching quality is also not good.We will get better item for this price I got it for Rs.599, ie 200 per piece. We will get more thick material and with better quality from Street vendors.

"
"

  The product is worth of money. Quality is good. Somewhat see through. Length and comfortability is grt👍🏻. I got 3 different prints, so happy😁.

"
"

  Every thing was good from styling to fabric and price but description was wrong I needed cotton fabric but it was synthetic that is why I had to return

"
"

  Clothe quality is worst. Item is not same as display. Product is China made.This seller is spoling amazon's image.

  Please don't buy as the products shown in the pics is completely different from what you receive.Material is very bad, low quality.very transparent not summer material

"
"

  It's a 3 pieces combo, out of which 1 is a complete waste - very bad material, transparent and definitely can't use it. How do we get a replacement for that 1 piece.

"
"

  Very bad product, fabric is poor, colour is poor & also I didn't receive the correct packet

"
"

  Not worth the money...if it's not cotton. And print was completely different. Only fooling public on this platform.

"
"

  Good Product

"
"

  1st, did not get the same as shown in the picture.2nd material is not good and it's see through. Very thin material not cotton,3 it's little short. If ur 5.7 and above u mite fine it short. Over all three stars

"
"

  Poor quality fabric. Disappointing to see such low quality fabric been marketed on Amazon. Material isn't cotton & so sheer that it's almost see through. Not at all recommended for shopping. Please remove off shelves.

"
"

  As everybody said completely different from what said n what i received, poor quality, transparent clothTotal waste if money

"
"

  Dress loses colour after first wash, don't wash with other clothes. Its not thick cotton cloth, its too transparent and isn't cotton or hosiery either.

"
"

  Could have been better the money we paid, very thin material

"
"

  The 3 pieces I received are good enough products for the money spent except that the designs are completely different from the picture shownNot satisfied with the received designs but I had no time to return as I was travelling . The dresses are really loose for the size

"
"

  I loved the material, though it's not cotton but it's very comfortable and light.For me I was expecting a bit bigger size as my height is 5.4 feet with average body structure.But still it's ok as I can wear it with a capri and it looks good.And the price you are paying for the same is worth.

"
"

  I was hesitating to buy these because of the cost factor tat i might get cheap material,  but i love these tops,  for tat price getting these tops is worth it and these tops are perfect for summertime.

"
"

  The material is very thin, transparent, I thought it would be cotton but its not cotton

"
"

  Patterns are different from the ones shown in picture , but they are all very preety and material is very soft .. me and my daughter both are wearing them and we love it !! Thanks for the nice product

"
"

  It’s an elastic nylon material, not hosiery cotton at all,cheap quality

"
"

  Very transparent and not as mentioned in description

"
"

  Comfortable clothing (cant wear in summer) .  But very thin cloth,  cloth is smooth .Different images not shown in the picture.But Happy for buying. For only bedroom use.

"
"

  It's ok ok product not very good n not very bad. The product I received is totally different from the picture, if u are looking for the same product u ll not receive so don't go for it.

"
"

  Really disgusting bakwas third class so much thin material and even so much differnt design or colour deliver ...this is ur service so cheap

"
"

  It is a nice product. I like the material. Its very comfortable to wear. Overall i loved it. Its worth in this money range.

"
"

  Size is not upto knee. It is shorter.

"
"

  The stuff received is different than what is narrated.

"
"

  Worse product as quality of product is very bad. Further, the product I received is not what I ordered for..don't buy.

"
"

  Too transparent.. Looks like a rag after 1 wash

"
"

  Product is not as shown in the website, 2 pc sent same out of 3 pc set, which are not displayed on website, poor quality as per as price concerned.

"
"

  The item as shown in website is completely different from what we recieved. The design and quality are different.

"
"

  Very poor material.. very cheap clothing

"
"

  material is soo soo cheap ,u can get this material at street shopping. I ll suggest not to buy this product by looking it looks attractive but not at allllll worthy

"
"

  Nice Product,

"
"

  It's length is short which I don't like it's looking like long Tshirt not dress but quality is fine & fitting is good free size.

"
"

  A little short in length, another two inches would have been good.

"
"

  The product material is very uncomfortable. In the pack of 3 all 3 were of different company and different sizes. The stitching was also very bad. Do not recommend this product to anybody.

"
"

  Very comfortable to wear.Good price.Nicely packed and delivered.Good design/color and graphics.Longevity of the product still to check.

"
"

  It is spr product ....bt it is very thin .... comfortable to wear in summer...and size is  different but I like the product

"
"

  Not a cotton materialAnd very  transparent and thin cloth.....Best design and look....best for rainy and winter season not for summer

"
"

  Good

"
"

  Bad quality

"
"

  Average

"
"

  The quality is very poor and dress is very transparent. Also the products are not delivered whatever model we choose. Not recommended to buy.

"
"

  V thin. Not thick fabric . else everything else is okay.

"
"

  THE PRODUCT RECEIVED WAS TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM AS SHOWN IN DESCRIPTION.BUT, DESIGNS WHICH WE RECEIVED WERE VERY GOOD.VALUE FOR MONEY....GO FOR IT

"
"

  Ok

"
"

  Product is good but not suggesting for long lasting use

"
"

  Quality is not good

"
"

  Color & design good but clothe very thin

"
"

  In the ad it shows 3 different nightie but I received all 3 same ...with same color....Also product is not the same as showsn in the picture....please don't order from this seller

"
"

  Girls go for it.it is so comfortable.and also very cute.but there is a small problem that it is not printed at the back.colours are very vibrant

"
"

  It is too short. Should have been a little longer

"
"

  Cheap quality fabric, don't buy it

"
"

  Very comfortable and usable in all seasons but we cant choose particular designs/colours.But Its fine all the designs and colours are cool.

"
"

  Out of 3 tops 1 is of not a good quality. Other 2 are superb.

"
"

  Worst material

"
"

  This product looks as like the images given in but the quality of the top is very thin and transparent. Disappointed on the quality.

"
"

  Too transparent to wear. Its like a dress made out of a butter paper and material is also not as mentioned

"
"

  Quality not as good as expected.

"
"

  Very bad experience3 t-shirts recived of same colour not even from the showing in pictures

"
"

  Very poor quality. In picture shows very different

"
"

  Nice one. Product is not same as shown in this picture .

"
"

  I like the comfort, but the quality must be less than the imagination of mine. The faith you have created must need bit more effort from your side.

"
"

  The product is not good, bad quality, worst product received ever. I recommend don't buy this.Thank you!

"
"

  The product says it is made of cotton, but two of the three sets were not made of cotton.

"
"

  Overall good product.

"
"

  Horrible quality, polyster material and Chinese made.. please don't waste your money..dont ever but...color faded in 1 wash

"
"

  Just ok

"
"

  this product is not cotton. but the print is cute.

"
"

  I ordered it by reading a description as cotton. But its not cotton. Won't be comfortable as a sleepwear.

"
"

  Awesome materialSo airy and stretchableU don’t feel hot

"
"

  AS PER ME THE PRODUCT IS REALLY GOOD IF U WANT COMFORT AT NIGHT SO YA SURELY U CAN BUY THIS PRODUCT ITS REALLY VERY SOFT.

"
"

  Very poor quality thin transparent fabric ....completely  different from the one shown in the picture ....not worth buying

"
"

  Very bad tricks played by the suppliers. It is shown this print and send other print. NOT HAPPY WITH ITS DIRTY TRICKS.

"
"

  Cheapest quality that you can expect from any seller, not worth at all. Moreover a Chinese make which is not published anywhere

"
"

  Utter waste

"

  ITS MADE IN CHINAMaterial is very thin n I got different print n colour is not as same in the picture.

"
"

"
"

  Very Comfortable and soft material.

"
"

  Quality of product is very bad. Stiches are opened from many places and overall the priduct is very small as needed

"
"

  Good cloth, very comfortable summer wear but its much shorter than whats shown in the pic. Girl should be like 4ft i guess.

"
"

  Product received is not any similar to one in picture. It is some baby pink and blue. Cloth material is very poor

"
"

  Not matching with the picture, still a good product. Very comfortable night wear

"
"

  Very bad quality it's print disappeared in just one wash.

"
"

  The quality is very bad and not at all worth the value

"
"

  Cheapest quality.do not buy.much shorter in size

"
"

"
"

  It's worst item, it's not hoesiry.

"
"

  I like the colour but i recived same dress twice... and one different colour  but its value for money good product

"
"

  Best dress ever, am happy for that. I got the same product with little bit difference but its nice only. Everyone can go for it.

"
"

  The prints are different and quality of maerial is poor. The material is see through and all sizes are different in the pack. Do not recommend this product.

"
"

  Market price per piece 100rup

"
"

  4 star because which i hv got vry different colours and desing of clothes as per given image vrry different otherwise material is too good.

"
"

  Size not shown  so I cancelled it size charts is not available for this item so I have to cancelled tat....

"
"

  Poor quality

"
"

  It's not the same what was shown on the pic.. Quality is not great.. Texture is not the same.. Not value for money..

"
"

  I love this product

"
"

  The photographs are for brightly coloured t-shirts. What we received was completely different and dull colors.Secondly, the material is very thin and transparent.

"
"

  This product is not good., quality wise very poor not satisfied., waste of moneyPlease don't buy 5his product

"
"

  The cloth is like plastic... Very short... Uncomfortable to wear... Waste of money

  Awesome product. Very soft and comfy. Breathable fabric. Great night wear

  Loved the skirt, pure cotton and comfortable soft cloth. Just received it and hope it doesn’t fade after washing. Recommend to buy.  Product received as per description.

"
"

  The size provided in the description is misleading.  The skirt that was bought should have fitted a person with 38 inches waist.  However this was probably for someone with at least 5 inches lesser.

"
"

  Little transparent,🙄but it's nice to wear.. comfortable too... I enjoyed the package was delivered at my birthday, very happy

  Don't buy this. Quality is poor. Stitching is uneven .  One side up and another side down. Uneven cutting. Horrible purchase.

  Good Quality and comfortable skirt.Completely worth the money.I have been using it for months as dailywear and it still looks beautiful.

"
"

  Thankyou😊such a comfortable wear 4 girls...i received mask along this😍

  I find this product is worthwhile, it gives comfort and the fabric is just like jaipuri cotton. I received this skirt as i selected over the website. Color and print what i selected , received the same.

  skirt has light colour bleeding. prefer hand wash. elastic is too tight. other than that, overall good.

"

  Comfortable for cold weather only ,not suitable for Summer because material is heavy.This product is getting dull after washing,but value for money.

"

  The colur is dull thanthe pic.. quality verygood... comfortable to wear.thanks Amazon

"

  Very rough material. Too thick. Fades away.

"

  It's really good but somehow it's looking old... But it's good...

"
"

  4 stars because the picture and product looks quite different however the product delivered seems good quality-wise.It's a very beautiful skirt😍

"
"

  Nice fabric, the colour didn't fade after many wash.👌👌 Just go for it.

"
"

  The product is not value for money it is looking like a cheap quality product and the colour is also different from the shown picture I did not recommended it and the product is not like 400 rupees

"
"

  This is a poor quality product and price is to high.

"
"

  It is not at all sameColour is also differentHeight is also less

"
"

  Quality is poor.

"
"

  Exactly as shown in picture but still not sure whether the colour will wash off with washing or not

"
"

  Nice material ,color nd length.dont waitMust buy

"

  Color mismatch, than from photo. Looking like used item. Amazon is not recommended to buy dresses.This is the second  time , same problem occurred. Total waste of time.

"
"

  Good Product,  Must Buy , Very Nice , Soft , Comfortable

"
"

  The product is amazingly beautiful and is exactly as I was looking for. The finishing is also very good. Nice Skirt and I like it very much and also Good Material. Thank You So much

"
"

  This is a nice and comfortable cotton skirt for summer. It is light and can be worn with different tops. The length is also perfect. I would recommend hand wash this skirt.

"
"

  Perfect fit but colour is different not shown in picture, blue shade,misleading colour.

"
"

  Material is food, though we will need to wait until the first wash!

"
"

  Value for money, not a soft cotton, good flare and will come to 38 waist

  The product color🎨 is a bit dull and it's different from the pic shown on Amazon. Looks like used

  Beautiful saree. It is really marvelous. I didn't expect this quality but really its beautiful like it appears in the pictureThe only thing is the blouse material is not red but white in color. No doubt it goes well with the saree n the blouse material is good too but the color in picture could be misleading so thought to specify.But any ways the saree is the extremely beautiful and rich.

"
"

  Looks jus like it is shown in the pictures. Came with a contrast maroon blouse piece.looks very graceful and elegant when draped. Though it's not pure organza, it looks like a tissue mix,but still looks very decent and classy. Go for it! It's a great buy for the price it's offered at!

"
"

  Not purely organza, blouse maroon. Nice saree but a little difficult to drape.

"
"

  The saree material is very good. I received the same exact blouse color as well.

"
"

  It is beautiful! I’m so happy I bought this, go for it! The fabric is amazing and it’ll look beautiful, comes with maroon blouse piece. Lovely buy.🤗

"
"

  Saree looks bland or too white i shall say . Also a bit shorter in length . Blouse colour is bit maroon and don't really go well with the saree. In total it gives a messy look rather than elegant.

"
"

  Love it!!!!

"
"

  I wanted to buy this saree for long and finally I purchased it. I saw this saree for some other price at different website and the price was bit higher. I opted for this as price in amazon was appealing, what I did not like about this saree is durability. This saree could be easily torn and need to be kept with safety else you won't be able to drape it.It is definitely not organza.

"
"

  I ordered this for my mother but she didn't like this at all. It's slippery and the length is short. It's not soft, feels like plastic.

"
"

  The overall look of this saree is very pretty. The fabric is little challenging. It's not as soft as it looks in the pictures yet stiff. For making the perfect pleates, you may have to iron the pleates. The fabric is nice and sheer. The blouse fabric is also decent. A satin or silk blouse would do wonders on it. I am happy with the purchase in this price.

  I loved this saree. Can't wait to wear it. This is super cute, beautiful, and elegant saree but the blouse piece is just a rag. I bought another blouse piece to match with this. And most importantly, this is is NOT off-white but it is a pure white one. If your family is having sentiment with white clothes, think about it. My rebuked me for purchasing a white one 😀As I liked it, I am not going to return.

"
"

  pretty good n awsom look

"
"

  sharee look absolutely luxurious & it's super comfy. The only problem is it really silky & it can fall off easily. So take care of that. Otherwise a good product

"
"

  Kudos to the promt delivery even before 24 hours. Saari is very light, sheer and just as pictured. Felt the blouse piece could have been bigger. But it would fit nicely to thin-medium built for a sleeveless blouse.

"
"

  Its not real organza.. Very bad quality... Polyster saree

"
"

  It's silky, it's smooth , looks elegant , not that soft , blouse material not good but yeah total paisa vasool as it looks pretty for the price.

"
"

  Worst quality. No one should buy this product. Waste of money. You can use it as curtain, if you feel like.

"
"

  I received it in good condition along with a blouse piece of maroon color.The sari is good.

"
"

  Looks good for young aged women, where as middle aged women it will be flashy, I ordered for my mother and she gave it to my sister..product was awesome 👏🏻

"
"

  Poor fabric quality. The design looks like a organza saree but its not organza. Looks like shiny polyster paperish fabric.

"
"

  I think this saree should be in your saree collection, it's beautiful lightweight easy to carry and valu for money saree 🤍. It looks very classy yet elegant.

"
"

  Some wine colour spots are there otherwise a good deal. I ordered replacement. Hope to get lucky this time. Once I get the replacement will review again.

"
"

  Its gorgeous. But the task comes when you start draping it, quite slippery and stiff. I got it for 709, now the price is reduced so a slight disappointment for me. Still, a pretty saree!

"
"

  Very nice product. Nice material. Soft and comfortable fabric. Soothing color. Must buy.

"
"

  It's transparent, so I wanted to pleat n wear it. It's impossible to pleat because the fabric is so slippery n stiff at the same time.

"
"

  Bought for my sister and she loved itThe color texture and material is far superior when considering pricePeople will turn around to see you ... was an awesome purchase

"
"

  I had to return the product since the saree has broad white lace at the border. The saree shown above doesn't have a lace. It changed the whole look.

"
"

  It's really awesome,light weight,soft and surprisingly elegant. I am very clumsy when it comes to wear a saree, but this saree got the most compliment. Do not doubt,buy it.

"
"

  Material is so light weight but not too easy to handle..its slightly down.

"
"

  The saree is exactly as shown in the picture, the blouse is darker in shade than expectedOverall good sareeThe saree seems overpriced for this quality

"
"

  Very good quality and price. I liked it and it is same as shown in picture.

"
"

  Blouse is different colourBut saree is amazing

"
"

  Quality is as expected. Good price compared to other sites. The design is very off beat.

"
"

  Very small sarees I return this

"
"

  I liked that it is light weight and pretty but i gave it 4 star because the quality is not pure organza but you can go for it for the price it's too good

"
"

  The saree is as beautiful as shown in picture. Must add this one in your wardrobe.Thankyou Amazon

"
"

  Ummm its good but material wise its hard to stay on bodyIt keeps faaling

"
"

  Gives a smart n elegant look on wearing it.

"
"

  I like saree as it's light weight n gives elegent look in very reasonable price.. Lil difficult to ware but once drape it's perfect

"
"

  So it's very light and quality is also amazing.If you are looking for it... You should definitely give a chance because it print is amazing and the material of blouse is also good.

"

  As compared to other app, i got here on cheap price...beautiful and elegant design saree but not soft,and it is not easy to carry or easy to wear

"
"

  It's beautiful.. little difficult to drape and manage though

"
"

  It's really good, I got it for my mom and she really loves it...it's quiet fancy and very light weight. Worth a try.

  Beautiful saree...Light weight and at reasonable price...Worth buy...Go for it... I loved it very much.... Beautifullight organaza saree.... 😑🤗🤗🤗🤗  Wonderful

"
"

  Never buy products from floral style. They are fraud and sell bet bad quality product. We bought from their site and had terrible experience

"
"

  Cheapest saree...don't buy ...waste of money.. material is not gud ...print is not like that... I suggest plz don't buy

"
"

  Product is good but extra collection of delivery man 720 rs collect...not fare so not satisfied with service please reply

"
"

  The saree is actually good.. pretty beautiful.. but is not that soft or comfortable.. good for some light occasions..but is definitely beautiful..

"
"

  It's a light weight saree,value for money.I love the colour combination.its exactly similar with photo shown in the site. Go for it

"
"

  Not a pure organza saree but a light weight sheer one. White floral saree gives a modern look for every occasion.

"
"

  Very beautif.ul I like it worth buying  those who want to buy they purchase it or buying it .i like it.

"
"

  I really liked this saree and the thing I liked most is , whether it's for a woman or a girl this looks great

"
"

  Its too transperent . And quality of the material is not good. Also sari height is small.

"
"

  I have ordered size large for my sister for rs999 but the size didn't fit well so I have ordered for an exchange and there was no problem with the exchange program, seller had immediately shipped the product it had reached on time, I have received extra-large kurta and my sister like it very well and it fit the best my advice is to take an extra size for better fit..

"
"

  This is really awesome I bought this for my wife & she loved this very much.

"
"

  Beautiful Dress. Very happy. The material is so good and this set comes with a beautiful pink coloured dupatta.

"
"

  This is a sober suit and adds elegance to your look., but the worst part is stitching issue resolve especially the slits... But this gives a fusion of ethnic and formal look... Classy...

"
"

  Fabric and quality is good..Color is also very good and decent.fitting is also good.must buy it without any doubt.

"
"

  Good go for it ...I got it for 849/-Soo wait for correct price dont buy when itz too high in price 🙂

"
"

  Same as shown in picture. Quality of cloth is excellent.  Fitting is also good.

"
"

  Very  Pretty  Just  go  for  it.  Very  good  for  office  . Value  for  money

"
"

  Nice quality product. Cotton material. No transperancy.  Perfectly fit.. my height is 5'6"" and weight is 68kg. I order L size that is perfect size for me. Little bit loose at waist. Nice product at this price 999/- duppatta is awesome .. only duppatta market price is 500/- great deal at this price... must buy. Plazzo is also comfortable to wear.

"
"

  Exactly the same as given in description and image. Nice costume overall..I bought this for Rs.850  but can see now the rate has been increased..this creates confusion and disappointment for the ppl i have shared who wanted to buy same item. The seller or amazon should be genuine enough to catch more customers

"
"

  I bought xl size but it was little tight for me generally for other brands xl is right size for me. But the quality and look of this product is awesome just love it.I would like to suggest if any one want to buy pls order one size bigger. And also i didn't like palazzo i altered it to straight pant nd now its looking good

"
"

  Dupatta is Chanderi and gives a lovely look to the suit. Palazzo can't be more fit length wise. It was an awesome deal buying this set. Suit gives an ethnic look as well as elegant look for office. Must buy recommendations. Just go for it

"
"

  I am not happy with dupatta cheat material used and shrunken. Top and bottom were nice but for 1149 they should have offered good quality dupatta..it is a silk duppatta like paper which needs frequent ironing. It would cost only 100 rs for dupatta

"
"

  Nice Quality.. I got matching mask also, which was not mentioned in the description...

"
"

  I like the material but i hd ordered midium size but when i receved it came out to be xxl

"
"

  The product quality is good but not at all true to the size. On raising exchange, they sent the same size again. I ordered XS (34) size as that's generally for all my clothes or sometimes even lessor size fits well. But this one could not even move below neck.

"
"

  It looks classy, at the same time it is comfortable too, you can wear it casually as well for any function

"
"

  Was little bit doubtful on the fitting and quality considering the huge discount the seller was offering, but was a great idea purchasing it.

"
"

  Cloth quality is good, got it at a good deal as well

"
"

  Colour material everything is fine, same as shown in the picture. But sent a complete different size. Had ordered XS but they sent XXL (think how a person who normally wears XS size can wear a product of XXL!!). Except that everything about the suit is nice...

"
"

  Material is soft and good cotton, shawl color is beautiful. Fitting is good, however I received dress first without shawl, later seller replaced it. Happy with the purchase

"
"

  Same as shown in picture..material is really soft.I got it at 789...very comfortable ..bt dupatta is small.colur did not fade afer washing so  many times.The material is not also shrinking.plazzo required some fitting..for s size..

"
"

  Black color..Very nice ...beautiful suit ..i loved ...length maine alter karvai hai ..i.am short so it was too long for me ..otherwise nice fabric ..lovely suit ..dupatta is very beautiful ..go for it ..

"
"

  No shrink after wash. Fits perfectly. And colour also not faded after several machine wash. Can buy without second thought

"
"

  I bought this for my mother and it's just awesome with full length vibrant Dupatta. The lower also has pocket for phone and stuff. The fitting of the Kurti is also good. Moreover the pink colour gives an awesome contrast with the base suit colour.

"
"

  The product is good and comfortable but I didn't receive dupatta with it. Going to return it now.

"
"

  Very comfortable and nice  color thank you❤🌹😊 Amazon

"
"

  The quality of the cloth is good, durable,but the sizes the companies are offering are too confusing,,, I generally order xl but since online shopping is unpredictable, I ordered xxl , even xxl is just ok, iam sure after one washing the cotton kurti will shrink and won't fit me ..

"
"

  THE DESIGN IS PERFECT FOR ANY AGE WOMAN TO WEAR IT BUT THE CLOTH QUALITY IS NOT UPTO THE MARK . THE CLOTH IS VERY THIN .WHEN I HAD RECEIVED MEDIUM SIZE , THE CLOTH QUALITY WAS MUCH BETTER THAN WHAT I GOT AFTER EXCHANGE AS THERE WAS A SIZE ISSUE . WHEN I RECEIVED THE XXL SIZE OF THE SAME PRODUCT , THE PRODUCT QUALITY WAS NOT THE SAME AS BEFORE. I THINK THE OFFICIALS SHOULD HAVE A LOOK INTO THIS. THIS XXL SIZE OF THE PRODUCT DID NOT HAVE LINEN.

"
"

  Very comfortable. Looks very classy. Fit is as expected. Not too tight and material is also breathable. Dupatta ends need to be stitched else threads keep coming off. Great add to the wardrobe

"
"

  quality of the material is very good.. the product is sane as shown in pictures.gorgeous and bright material.. recommend to buy without any doubt.The price is also lesser than other shopping apps..Thanks amazon

"
"

  Just for it..  Fabric is awesome and comfortable.. Also one suggestion from side regarding size is go for one large size of yours.. Then it will fit perfectly.. My size is xs but I have ordered S.. This fits perfect to me

"
"

  For my height and weight i have ordered an xs piece and top is few inches long for me. Bust, waist and bottom is super fitting.. It is 💯 cotton and very comfortable and classy

"
"

  Very good product ,nice fit ,value for money  and nice feel comfortable and  home  wash and Dupatta is also so very nice .. even after washing this fabric feels as it is and it is a really good product a big thumbs up for this

"
"

  Product is of good quality. Fit is not what I usually get for the M size. The waist fit is a little uneven for M and I assume will be too large for L if I had taken that. Still  manageable. The outfit looks elegant though.

"
"

  elegant and simple style dress. looks really good with traditional looks. quality of fabric is also good with nice fit and finish.

"
"

  This was a great surprise.  Did not expect it to be so soft and fit so well. Excellent price. Well fashioned and my favorite color combinations. Dupatta length 2m

"
"

  The palazzo is little loose for me .. and the length of the kurta also little long .. bt its okh because I always got long kurta because of my height .. overall good product .. it give vibes of sanskari girl or doing  govt job or best for interview .outfit

"
"

  Guys trust me.. This is really amaaazing... The quality of the dress...i hv no words literally.... At such a price you r getting this!!!... Really really happy with the dress... Gonna buy more from this brand...

"
"

  WORTH MONEY BUY WITHOUT SECOND THOUGHTFITTING IS GOODDRAPE IS EXECELLENTGOOD STITCHINGHUE AND COLOUR IS AWESOMEGIVES SUPERIOR QUALITY FEEL

"
"

  I gifted the dress to my mom in law on her 60th bday.. She was looking gorgeous In the black dress

"
"

  Expensive at 950 Rs.not value for money product

"
"

  I ordered it by watching it's look over model though not having any idea about the cloth but when I received it, the cloth is not compatible to its look. It's not a refined cotton or its blend but it is something thicker than that. Palazzo is too loose aa per the size I ordered. But it's overall nice.

"
"

  Bought it for 1000  worth nice look but not soo grand look elegant ..worth to buy for occasion wear

"
"

  Extremely happy 🥰it's a very sober kind of suit,n the fabric material is very very good the dupatta is beautiful, Lovely suit I got.

"
"

  A must buy! Excellent quality and color combination is too sophisticated and elegant. Worth the money.

"
"

  Perfect fit.. good quality..  my mom loves the set..I gifted for her birthday and she just loved it.. 😊 same as the image shown..😊 very happy!! Worth buying!

"
"

  As i have ordered xs size i found the fitting is okay but kurta is too large looks elegant .. but i,m short heighted so i need to alter the Palazzo it doesn't look that gud on me .. but the can be use in day and night both a perfect look!

"
"

  The dress quality is really good its value for moneyKurta is good and duppatta is also very niceThe dress is same as shown in the picture.

"
"

  Same as shown in the image. Fits well. Good quality product.

"
"

  Waw...its very comfortable and good quality kutra set its khadi types of material which is very comfortable I highly recommend go for it

"
"

  Slightly transparent but quite better than other products on AmazonStitching nice. Very good infectOverall good quality product

"
"

  Average product. Not excellent. Value for money. Quality of the meterial is fair for the price. Need to improve on quality. Four star because of value for money. Else the quality is worth three star only.

"
"

  I liked it very much as I gifted to my mother and she liked this dress very much. Perfect fitting and material is too good.

"
"

  The clothe quality is good, it's just awesome 👌👌👌👌👌👌

"
"

  It came early. The fabric is good and more than expectations. It is a complete suit.  It has a shirt, a bottom with colourful printed border along with a dupatta. All over I'm satisfied with the purchase. It cost me around Rs1000.

"
"

  Dupatta is pathetic. I can't wear it for even one time. Kurta and Palazzo fabric is good but attached measurements are wrong so this is too large for me. Have invested 200 rs more for alteration. Overall this was not good deal for me.

"
"

  Fabric is good but not a pure cotton as mentioned in the product details....bad experience with the delivery boy....he was so rude and impatient....Amazon management needs to work on this and teach their delivery guys about the delivery etiquette.

"
"

  Simply Amazing!!! She Loved it ❤️.Do not think. Buy and its best suited for pics

"
"

  Received same product as shown in the picture.  Fits as described in the size chart.  Cloth is good but not 100% cotton as mentioned, still stitching is good 👍

"
"

  The product is gud. But after 3 use there is lint formation on the sleeves.

"
"

  Excellent dress, worth buying it.Specifically duppata gives shiny appearance.

"
"

  Suit quality n fitting is too good. But dupatta quality is not good had torn in edges. Since I liked the fitting n suit I didn't exchange. Needs improvement in dupatta quality.

"
"

  Colour is very dull ..quality is not good ..this product is 850 ...mrp is 2499 which is fake .. only shawl is good ...waste at this price..I saw good reviews but all waste now

"
"

  Fantastic product, tiny bit loose in medium size compared to other companies but it looks amazing in pictures. Haven't washed yet hence not sure about material shrinking and colour bleeding

"
"

  Dress colour dress material everything is very nice and I come to you like that thank you so much

"
"

  This suit and dupatta set is elegant. Stitched perfectly. Check the size chart to order the right size. Very happy with the purchase. Thank you, Amazon and Indo Era! 😄

   Awesome product, nice material.Must buy for budget buyers like me… suits for any occasion.  Definitely will order from this brand again.

"
"

  A good and affordable product to buy and use. The salwar sameej suit is comfortable to use with a decent outlook.

"
"

  . The best quality product I got from Amazon.......... I can't thank u enough for this........ The cloth quality is super what I expected......... Color is sober......... So Happy with purchase....... Worth buying...

"
"

  The design and style is beautiful.But I think the cloth is not pure cotton.It is a bit thick fabric that is best for winter. It does not need ironing also and the fabric is of standard quality.overall the product is worth every penny.

"
"

  Its very soft ,elegant & comfertable cloth looking as beautiful as in picture

"
"

  After first wash no colour bleed no shrinkage.its wonderful at this price.

"
"

  Fabric is fine not very good quality..overall look wise it’s good and because of dupatta it looks more  beautiful..

"
"

  Good purchase. Looks classy. Material quality is really good. Got in offer. True to size chart.

"
"

  Nice fabric and beautiful duppatta.

"
"

  I have to return as dupatta is missing when delivered.It’s just a plain top and pant without dupatta and I felt overpriced if dupatta is not added to it

"
"

  Value for money. Thickness of the product is good. Quality of cloth is also nice.👌

"
"

  I LIKED IT VERY MUCH. FABRIC QUALITY IS ALSO GOOD..!

"
"

  This dress fits me at the point.. no less no more...perfect... This dress looks too classy and decent.... perfect casual wear or even a tea prty wear.... must buy one.... should must buy this to upgrade and enhance ur wardrobe

"
"

  Comfortable and good fit.Value for money

"
"

  Very good product..highly recommended..comfortable and quality material..give a classy look..i got alot of complement

"
"

  Just go for it. Value for money. Everything is perfect. Thank you Amazon 🙂🙂

"
"

  Both top and bottom are pure cotton fabric.

"
"

  The product is very good but I had expected that dupatta will be the highlight for this kurta, but it was not. That's ok no problem it was over all a good product. Thanks to indo era and amazon. I should say this the packing is awesome, I just loved it.

"
"

  Its more synthetic. Duppatta is alsonot upto the mark. Fitting is ok. Nor worth the price

"
"

  We purchased the XXL size, though the product was a little tight than expected. Had it been a little lose, it would have been amazing. Nevertheless, a good product.

"
"

  The fabric is quite similar to khadi..very comfortable and elegant. Happy withy purchase. Got this for 799.

"
"

  Material is not pure cotton...duppatta width is less..and colour of salwar suit is not as shown in picture..lighter shade... I kept it but not as expected.

"
"

  Comfortable cotton cloth, good fit and specially the value for money. Such good quality at optimum price. Loved it totally.

"
"

  Overall quality is very goodValue for moneyFit as expected

"
"

  Amazing fabric... Truely a money worth product. Color and size is perfect... Without a doubt just buy it...😎😎😎😎.

"
"

  I am happy to this dress .its value for money .really cloth is too good it's  like a kadhi cloth very comfortable ..just we order the correct size .... Go for it must buy thiss

"
"

  This is just Wow! Just go for it ..

"
"

  Value for Money!!Fit, colour and feel everything as expected.

"
"

  It’s not pure cottonBut very beautifulI’m happy

"
"

  Fabric is very good.. same as shown in pictures..

"
"

  Beautiful and worth the value

"
"

  Totally as it was shown and mentioned on Amazon site. Really like this set of kurta.

"
"

  Dress if comfortable and soft cloth and decent rich look

"
"

  Suit is of cotton mix and its getting bubbles after wearing it for 2-3 times..rest look wise and fitting everything goes perfect

"
"

  The dupatta is of very cheap low quality! Fabric too thick and measurements are all Wrong!

"
"

  very very nice outfit.. xlsize is good fr me

"
"

  Beautiful

"
"

  Nice looking

"
"

  Material is good and comfortable to wear. Dhuppatta gives grand look.

"
"

"
"

  Nice quality product

"
"

  It's really good product

"
"

  I loved it. It’s very nice. Color is really good. Perfect fit

"
"

  Looks like faded colour and the new freshness is not there

"
"

  Sophisticated

"
"

  In a single use the cloth got bubbles,, it's a branded cloth don't know if the result of branded cloths is like this,, then what about unbranded..?? But fitting is perfect.

"
"

  Very comfortable very beautiful nice suit to wear in party.I am happy to buy this.

"
"

  Good quality product

"
"

  Product quality good but i have to return this due to not fit size

"
"

  Good

"
"

  a bit transparent and light... but overall good!!!

"
"

  I brought this for my mother.she likes it but palazzo is litte bit irregular in shape, wide from upside and narrow from down, may be due to lace that is given below in palazzo. Overall nice.

"
"

  The color was not as per the picture

"
"

  Size is not standard.

"
"

  Very good quality cloth material. Colours are bright.

"
"

  The product is fine.

"
"

  Very bad quality and look too

"
"

  Overall good quality fabric.Only fitting needed.

"
"

  It’s a must buy. Great fabric, perfect fit and comfort. Very Elegant

"
"

  No words.. just awesome

"
"

  Fabric is soft and fit is perfect.lt is exactly as shown in pic.The colour of dupatta doesn’t come out even after wash.

"
"

  The dress is very nice. Material is soft and fits well. Easy to iron. Seems to take less maintenance.

"
"

  Very good

"
"

  It's very good

"
"

  I just loved the suit, very comfortable, nice fabric. just go for it without a second thought

"

  Simple and elegant, fabric quality is good.

"
"

  Dress gives very elegant look when you wear , Dupatta is the real charmer. Loved the dress

"
"

  Good product, quality is good

"
"

  Due to size issue, requested for return. No one came to pickup the item and not giving proper information upon calling.. Not satisfied with the service

"
"

  Pleasant combination and side pocket in the pant is useful

"
"

  The fit is very bad.

"
"

  The purchase was worth it. I bought the M size. Perfect for an evening get together function. The fitting was perfect. After wash also it has not lost it's charm.

"
"

  Nice fit and cloth, value for money.. my girl loves it Thank you.. amazon and Womens Era..😇😇😇

"
"

  Pretty decent product and stuff is good, will surely recommend it.

"
"

  Nice fitting, nice fabric.dupatt is very attractive. First I got set without  dupatta but later they exchanged the set with dupatta.

"
"

  Quality of product is very good color is also same as in shown in picture worth buying product

"
"

  The dress material is good but it somehow looked very bad on me. May the colour doesn’t suit my skin tone.

"
"

  Very rich and decent material

"
"

  Dupatta not a great quality, the price reduced after I placed the order

"
"

  Good

"
"

  Good as expected 🙂

"
"

  Didn’t look as good as shown in picture. Fabric is okay

"
"

  Awesome material, looks fresh.. Worth the price.. Size is perfect!!!!

"
"

  Dress material was so good and colour is as expected ...but it was oversize.. like I had ordered s size and it's look like xl. So please work on it.Lastly nice product.

"
"

  Fabric is not the best but good. But the whole product looks damn nice. As a person who doesn't have much ethenic dresses in her wardrobe. This will be too useful.

"
"

  Perfect size very comfortable

"

  Good fabric

"
"

  Its a great product from Indo era, glad that I bought one size extra. The quality of fabric is amazing, never felt any fabric so soft and light yet its not transparent. The front design should be little wide but still i got more than what I had expected. Go for this dress without thinking twice.

"
"

  I am in love with the dress, perfect ethnic wear for traditional lovers .I bought xs and it fit me well please go for your own size as even after wash the color, size, softness and comfort all remained the same.A must buy.

"
"

  The product is good but after it got delivered the price went down .....boooohooooo😭😭😭....why why why......but jokes apart product is awesome.. surely recommend to everyone who is looking for ethnic wear..it has a colour resemblance of MUGA our Assam silk....

"
"

  Ordered size 44 for my mother. Received size 42!The tag says xxl. But when I measured it, it was size xl

"
"

  Very very soft and wonderful formal wear. Fit was as mentioned in the chart. It worth buying in this range.

"
"

  Nice product....gives eligent and graceful look to your personality....cloth is comfortable and thick.... Nice fitting. Must buy this product for simple and eligent look.

"
"

  As shown in picture.....fitting is awesome

"
"

  Love it it's amazing.. I like the colour alot decent n lovely... Graceful. .. Cute.. Nice fabric value for money

"
"

  I loved the colour first of all simple sober price is decent chunni lightens colour litl bit after first wash u can wear it anywhere office meeting shaddi jagrata rakhi dinner or evenings i wud give 9 out of 10before buying i was worried bcz it waz my bday gift nd wore on tht day.

"
"

  Speciaally like fabric and colour combination,fitting is also good,without duppatta also wear in office use,festive as well as formal use👍

"
"

  Ordered this product twice, but each time received defected duppatta. So finally have to return this product. Sender needs to cross verify the product before delivering.

"
"

  Quality is very fine...worth to purchase...same as shiwn in picture..i love its dupatta, just beacause of dull color of suit i returned it...otherwise overall item is impressive

"
"

  there is no dupatta with this set but they shows dupatta also... i receive this product without dupatta and without dupatta its looks ok ok..... feel bad🙁

"

"
"

  Superb quality, it's a soft fabric, value for money. No second thought, go for it.Only thing is dupatta quality could have been little better.

"
"

  Checking reviews!?then don't worry...product os absolutely perfect as expected....Fabric quality is good.... everything is perfect ....must buy...worth for the 💰

"

"
"

  It's not pure cotton and not suitable for summers in hot weather.. suitable for mix weather or winter wear

"
"

  It is very soft and comfortable. The fit overall is very nice. The thickness is aslo nice. Worth buying it. But a bit small for me cause I am 5:10

"
"

  I dont like this product... Very transparency.... Dont ever buy this.... Hated it...... Bad quality.,..... Bad material...... Not so comfort

  1) Soft cloth, elasticized waist is not over-tight2) Color does not run during washing3) Needs gentle liquid detergent; use of powdered detergent causes it to lose shape4) Threads were coming loose from the seams of some of the items5) May last longer when washed by hand6) Individually packaged in cardboard cartons and placed inside a sturdy Rupa box7) Colors are dark just like in the product photo8) Does not leave marks on the waistUpdate as of 18-Sep-2018: Product is holding well after several washes, but threads are randomly coming loose. Color does not run.

  Nice and good quality product for this price...Last month i ordered Rupa Jon panties 5 no's from other seller...that was my first purchase of ladies panties online...i was afraid of the fake product and the size..so i have decided to buy 5nos and check....So i bought a set of 5 nos...it was really good, cotton material..my size was 90 (large)...but these panties are bit tight near the hip...but it was not a big issue...i can wear it...but i thought of ordering next size...So i ordered second time, from cloudtail sellers, for 10nos....got that today....its really comfortable for me...and one good thing is that i have got all the 10 panties in different colours....amazing!!! ( they have shown only 5 colours in the picture..)...if we buy good quality panties from the local store,it will cost more than 100₹...but this will cost only less than 40₹...its value for money as well...it comes with good packaging too...attaching the picture...hope this will help u all....

"
"

  These are not the product of Rupa, you send local product, no Rupa sticker, no size mention, every wash colour start to running out, how could you do this with your regular costumer, this time I am very disappointed.

"
"

  Ordered 10 pieces But get 9 piece I give money for 10 pieces . So one pieces money is waste and not cloth just good and not symbol for Rupa and not name for Rupa .Early I write review for this product on 18-12-2019. But 26-01-2020 did not find my review so again write ...

"
"

  Received 8 pieces instead of 10 pieces. The product is not labelled by Rupa manufacturer. It seems that a non branded product  sent without  any label and packing.

"
"

  Prdoct show in Amazon 10 pieces really I receive only five pieces so don't purchase this item , waste of money, waste of time

"
"

  Product not proper one side it shows 4xl 115 cm and other side it claims 4xl 110 cm . Not proper product . Really not happy.

"
"

  Product is good but printed price in the box is 460/-, where price written here is 521/-and after discount (!)it is 469/-. What rubbish!!!!

"
"

  1) Soft cloth, elasticized waist is not over-tight2) Color does not run during washing3) Needs gentle liquid detergent; use of powdered detergent causes it to lose shape4) Threads were coming loose from the seams of some of the items5) May last longer when washed by hand6) Individually packaged in cardboard cartons and placed inside a sturdy Rupa box7) Colors are dark just like in the product photo8) Does not leave marks on the waistUpdate as of 18-Sep-2018: Product is holding well after several washes, but threads are randomly coming loose. Color does not run.

   No label on the product indicating brand name or size.Visibly looked too small.Some of the items are dirty.Quality is missing.

"
"

  Nice product. My wife loved it. It's so soft and classy looking. Got it around 315. Affordable and comfortable.

"
"

  It is showing as 10 pcs pack but I recvd only 5 piece. The photo with 10 pcs is deceptive.

"
"

  Received these panties yesterday... niceand  good quality cotton panties....bought Rupa Jon plain panty set  also...it cost only ₹ 369.75 for me, after applying  coupon...... I got these panties in five colours ....colours are also good... brown colour -3nos, navy blue- 3, maroon-2, black-1, blue-1...It is little bit thin ...but it doesn't matter considering the price....good for daily use..attaching the picture...

"
"

  the product is good but it makes a fool out of u they dont send 10 pieces it contains  only 6 .... I have being shopping on Amazon for almost 5 years now never had this problem  ... please be careful while buying this product ... out to fool people

"
"

  The best feature of this design is that nowhere is the elastic exposed, so it doesn't cause rashes on the skin.Both at the waist and around the thighs, only soft cotton hosiery material touches the skin.Extremely good for people who have senstive skin.

"
"

  Love it,comfortable loose underwear for everyday use.I got the bulk pack because after running I can just wash up and change into new ones.I have about more than 10 in total,Cotton is great ,changing underwear after a run makes me feel fresh and also I don't mind if these get stained during periods.It worked out to 45 rs per panty with the discount coupon.I suggest you go for it.Worth it and cheaper than market rate.Sure the designs are not fancy but I prefer dark muted colors like these.I also cut out a hole and repurposed the box as a storage for all panties in general.Overall, loved it.Cheap and comfortable.

"
"

  Worth the price and fabric is fair.But worth the price.

"
"

  Highly disappointed with the material.It's very thin material, stitches are coming out, already cloth is having holes.Just not worth buying.. Please improve the quality of fabric and focus on stitching and elastic..

"
"

  It was very sad experience. Some of them were of very poor quality stiching

"
"

  The size is just too small. For anyone ordering this product, plz order one size larger. I ordered L size but it's as good as M size of other brands.. can't even return the product. Also, the description doesn't mention that these panties are scented, while they actually are. It has a weird smell which doesn't fade even after 1-2 washes. Plz go for some other brand if you have options.The only good thing is that the colours are good, mostly dark assorted.. so if you want to go ahead with the purchase, order one size larger than your regular ones

"
"

  Road side product is very good than this product. Waste cloth nd small size. It's transparent waste of money never buy inners, dresses in online totally froud nd worst product.

"
"

  Soft Cotran Cloth, Elestic can use long use quality, No color patching, I review it after use of 15 day and regular wash.If any one review negative, means wrong review.Must buy a very excellent quality product at a very very low price.

"
"

  Sent different brand product. Received only 5 numbers. Can't return and hence disappointed.

"
"

  Very worst product.I ordered for 10 pieces but got only 2 and also kids size...quality also very bad .The product received also not tuna brand,it is a local product.I hope Amazon not to entertain such bad products..

"
"

  Worst product.. instead of 10 piece I received only 5 and in that 2 got damaged.. quality is worst .. not recommended at all.. total money waste.. wanted to give 0 stars..

"
"

  Disappointed, order for 10 nos, received ony 9 nos, totally different item received.Bad experience with the purchase made, totally unhappy.

"
"

  First  of all there is no tag on these. Totally fake product and after one wash they look so bad. Its for one time use only.

"
"

  Seller is most 3rd class . I got received only 6 pcs.  Not 10 pcs . Or this also like another road side  item.  Very low quality.  Packing was rubbish.  No one large box( there mention or display images) and each panty was packed very thin polithin.  This product r non returnable item.  Not Amazon verified . So do not buy this item

"
"

  Don't buy it. I just received it. DON'T EFFING BUT IT! The cloth material is really cheap and flimsy. Not of a good quality at all.

"
"

  Duplicate items received. All are unbranded. Not rupa jon as mentioned. No size mentioned. Poor quality. Many are of small size. Unable to return. Very disappointed with Amazon. Kindly dont buy.

"
"

  This is not roopa jon product. It is only five in nos in place of 10 as described on site  and local made item small product.

"
"

  Very poor quality equivalent to roadside sellers . Disappointed by the service.Using a brand name but sending different material.

"
"

  Prons1. delivered on time2 . Elasticity is goodCons:1. Quality of the cloth is really bad.2. Stitches are bad and threads are already coming out before using itI would like to return this product as I am really disappointed

"
"

  Product quality is not good. After 2 to 3 wash, all the stitching came off.

"
"

  After going through so many negative feedback, I thought ""let's take a chance "" because of the ongoing situation it will not be a wise decision to go outside for shopping..so I ordered here..the product is an original one, with exact size it describes and the material is very comfortable(of course because its the  original one)...I am very happy with this buy..

"
"

  Great fabric , comfortable fitting & colours don't wash away , though if you dry in sun they may faint over time . Overall a very good stuff for day 2 day use . Got  10 pieces set @ rs: 345 , i.e. rs: 34.50 per piece . Even local shops sells the same @ rs: 35-45.Only downside is in the pack of ten you would only get 5 colors i.e. 2 blacks , 2 red and so on ... If there were more color variety that would sure to have added a charm .Overall a nice deal go for it .

"
"

  Received these panties yesterday... niceand good quality cotton panties....bought Rupa Jon plain panty set also...it cost only ₹ 269.10 for me, after applying coupon...... I got these panties in five colours ....colours are also good... brown colour -3nos, navy blue- 3, maroon-2, black-1, blue-1...It is little bit thin and long...but it doesn't matter considering the price....good for daily use..attaching the picture...

"
"

  Worst quality, non branded. Ordered pack of 10 and received pack of 8.

"
"

  Reading some of the reviews, I was afraid of ordering from other sellers, so I placed the order with Cloudtail. I bought it for ₹446 while some sellers sell it for as less as ₹360. But it is still a cheaper deal compared to those available in shops.The material is very soft and comfortable. Fitting is perfect - not overly tight anywhere. But it is very delicate and I think we might have to wash it by hand gently.I got 10 panties in nearly 10 different bright beautiful colours. But the colour does not bleed when washed. Overall it was a worthy purchase. Considering the price, we can use this for a few months and not regret throwing it away after the time is over.

"
"

  At the price at which it is offered not only do you get a great deal quantity wise but quality wise too.I could use it for one year. The issues with the product are color fading. The inner elastic starts revealing. Stitches side wise come off..but these are the results of regular usage. It is very comfortable to wear. Doesn't itch. Doesn't cause soreness in inner thighs or bikini areas. Fit is very comfortable too. If you're looking for a good deal in daily wear..go for it.

"
"

  Received only 5 pieces, not 10 😠😤 5 packets received and each packet has only 1 unit 😠😠😠 They are Fooling people's.No return or exchange as it comes under lingerie 😠😠😠😠

"
"

  I received damaged product and its not eligible to return.

"
"

  I ordered a set of 10 pics but I  got 5 only so I am not satisfied.

"
"

  Very very bad product....they send some achiever brand and only 5 pieces ....please dont buy it at any cost..

"
"

  The product was supposed to be large size L. But the product was too small to be called large. We tried to contact the manufacturer in Calcutta, but they were indifferent to our queries. It was one of the worst purchases we have made through Amazon. Normally, size L is 90 to 95 cm. but this was less than even 85 cm. the product could not be utilised.

"
"

  Receive the same product as described by the seller that is why giving 5-star rating.You may read others reviews and find mixed rating, not this product but If you're received the right product you will find that this is good.Fabric Quality is good not pure cotton but blended cotton.

"
"

  Best deal I got, and with expected quality.I got this in discount Rs. 440 for 10 pieces. 44/- for one piece 🤩Comfort and fit as expected. Very soft garment. And bonus is, have received all pieces in different colours, which was not expected and needed but yes it gives pleasure to one

"
"

  The size is smaller than expected. Need to replace with a bigger size.

"
"

  The brand is really nice. The package is nice & it came the same as the catalog. The cloth quality is also very nice & soft. It is soft for your skin. But the cloth durability is very less, It will go for 2-3 months after that it starts rip-up. But at this price range, the product is nice. You can go for it if you are okay for 1-2 months of use.

"
"

  1) It's mentioned pack of 10. But I received only 8 peices. It has happened before too when I read the other reviews.2) My requirement was size-L. But I bought size- XL . So make sure you order one size bigger otherwise u will have to again return it.3) Quality is good, material is also soft. But we'll get to know more after use.

"
"

  1. Colours bleach (heavily)2. Quality otherwise good3. Good fit4. Comfortable and soft5. However, I don't think they would last long enough. It may start to have wobbles after a couple of wash.6. Still at this price I think a year is more than enough.

"
"

  Very comfortable.. i always used costly branded underclothes.. but I seen this in a suggestion and went for it... I found this great on fabric.. very comfortable.. appropriate sizeOnly negative thing is stitchings are not that good.. often threads are peeping out and pulling those may unstitch whole side.

"
"

  There is manufacturing defect. The stitches have come out in brand new unused underwear. I would like to return since unused, if not that atleast reversal of payment should be done.

"
"

  Very thin, size is very small. Very cheap product. No brand, size print or label. Also it's not 10 pack, I received only 5 pack. Utterly waste. Don't waste your money. I ordered for XL size but received nearly M size.But Amazon assisted me well. However don't fall on this product.Amazon saved my money, by giving refund

"
"

  Worst experience, product packing worst, half quantity received, mentioned 10 packs, but I received only 5, I lost my money in this purchase.shows not refundable. Replacing option also not there. Quality is not as expected. A branded company should have option of replacing at least.,that’s why I do online shopping.The worst thing is pant packing , half quantity and quality, which increase my anger in morning, and when I saw the packet at room corner.

"
"

  Received only 5. Not the same as shown in pictures. Also small for the size described.

"
"

  Product quality is not good and I have ordered 10 items but I got only 8 items. I ordered for medium size but got 2 items of large size and 6 with medium size.

"
"

  It is as expected and good quality

"

   The quantity indicated may attract you but it will surely disappoint after you received the product.I've received only 05 out of 10. MRP indicated in the box is Rs.62 per piece.Overall I've paid more for the 5 piece received.It's better not to fool the customers with this type of products. It's seems that the seller taking the advantage of this product being classified as non returnable item.

"
"

  The product is too large. If you wear a Clovia size L(90) then you should purchase a size M(85). Also, these are high waise underwears. So they will go right above to your stomach if you try to fit them. Also, Amazon has a non-returnable policy for this product. So in no way will you be able to return it if the size doesn't fit. Amazon customer service will say 'No' to you no matter what you say.

"
"

  Very Nice Product , but I received only 5 pieces, same day I registered a complaint of this and immediately I received a call from Amazon and issue resolved by refund.

"
"

  I received a packet containing only eight panties instead of ten.The quality is not good. The logo on panties is missing. Two years back I had purchased this item that time quality as well as packing was good. Now the product is not up to the mark. Quality is poor and I had asked for replacement but no reply.

"
"

  In the picture and description there pack of 10 is shown, but I received item with only pack of 5, so I give only one star,

"
"

  Pack had majority black colour and size is on size smaller than expected. Comfort is average as it does not fit as expected.

"
"

  Cheating end customer by sending only 3 qty and wrong size. It is fit for only babies.Moreover packet was also cut. Very bad quality and refund also not giving. Highly unacceptable product.

"
"

  The quality is nice. I got ten different colours all in proper packing. The only thing is that I should have ordered a size bigger than my actual size, because they are smaller than the actual size.

"
"

  Really comfortable, thinnish material( thus dries faster, good for monsoons and travel) doesn't bleed. Good pricing.Was worried about ordering 10 non returnable goods but am happy with the purchase.Only con- threads unravel in some after use.

"
"

  The best part is the cotton material which is soft and comfortable and perfect fitting. The second thing is the design with full coverage and fabric covered elastics that does not brush against skin. The third is the price for the number of panties (10). Overall, very budget friendly, comfortable and affordable.

"
"

  Chiiiiii..it's really a very bad product...

"
"

  The product is comfortable and all that but the cloth quality is too bad that it didn’t last even a month before which it started literally tearing off. Even the color doesn’t run off and the cloth is soft. But I literally had to throw them away one by one in just a few uses.

"
"

  I ordered 10 panties but I got 5 only

"
"

  Ton of thanks to Amazon 🤩♥️❤️💖💓💕😍🤗because seller send me wrong item nd product was not returnable but Amazon settel all things nd within a two days I got my right product 👌👌👌👌really amazon is a trustworthy

"
"

  Astonishing ,as expected but didn't last long and as said in the pictures,snugly fits, follow the instructions from the chart given for the size , color faded after 1st wash ,seems to be not a good buy,very disappointed

"
"

  fake product,no tag of Rupa john, and out of 10 I received only 5.realy upset from the seller.the packing also very bad.no individual boxes given. panties are only in packet. when I bought it previous time then it was not same. then I really satisfied of this product but this time I really sad.

"
"

  The products are too bad,the size ordered is totally different from the size I have got.I have got the smaller size and the quantity is also less. In the product description,the no of panties shown and described is 10 while I have got 5 panties that too one in worst condition. This combo is too bad and is waste of money only

"
"

  Fake product, not original, they have printed the sticker of Rupa Jon,but it's NOT ORIGINAL RUPA. There is no trademark sign on the underwear. The size is too small and the cloth material is worst. If you want to get cheated then only buy this product. It's Amazon's duty to check the Authenticity if the product. But Amazon failed miserably. I am So So upset to get FAKE RUPA JON. There was NOT EVEN A BOX PACKING. They packed it in plastic because it's a FAKE PRODUCT

"
"

  They are cheating customers. They supplied only 05 panties while the order mentioned 10 panties. The order was for XL size while, they supplied L. The price for XL was more than L. Also, L is a smaller size and does not fit me.Plus the product falls under cannot be returned/replaced category. So, do not order such products.

"
"

  Unexpectedly I am loving this product, I was dubious about the quality based on its price. But am so thankful for this product now, it's the cheapest rate for 10 sets of pante. Just loving this smooth and good quality pante.

"
"

  I ordered a pack of 10 2XL size panties but received a pack of 5 L size panties. What do I do with them now. It's a non returnable item.It's not what I ordered, it's a different product altogether. I'm very upset. This has happened 2nd time with me. Last time also I received panties much smaller in size. They are still lying in my house good for nothing. I'm simply wasting my money by believing on Amazon.

"
"

  I wasn't expecting it to be this awesome. But it turned out to be very good. Infact at the time I bought it , it costed me 300-400 i guess, and for that much money the product altogether is simply awesome. I would highly recommend it for daily use, also it is 100% cotton and is good for summer season. I would recommend to order one size bigger as it will give you more comfort that way.

"
"

  It's perfect.. great product at that price. At first I was skeptical ordering this as it's non returnable item and also due to previous bad experiences from other vendors at Amazon. But was forced to order online as going to stores now is really risky and was pleasantly surprised with the quality.

"
"

  I ve got 8 pieces( instead of 10)..no label..no size printed..some seem L ( I had ordered XL)And some seem MMaterial is just about okIf it wasn't for the  pandemic would never have ordered online

"
"

  Very bad quality, material is very thin, Elastic same out of the sticking. Corner threads came out due to very low poor quality of sticking. Don't buy it. Waste of money.

"
"

  I just bought by seeing the name Rupa coz it's of high standard. But I was highly disappointed seeing it's quality. It's a very very poor quality product.

"
"

  Product is good. Cloth is cotton and not too thick and not too thin. Soft and well tailored. For the given discount approx Rs 33 per piece, it is good enough. They were 10 in no.

"
"

  I was sent a pack of 6 only. Don't buy.

"
"

  I bought it in a discounted rate but the product is very nice. The packing of every single box is also good. It is absolutely not that like old stock has been cleared at a discounted rate.Anyone can go for it

"
"

  package is received today in that out of 10 panties only 5 panties were there. please send the missed 5 panties soon.

"
"

  Received only 5 pieces instead of 10 for 450Rs. Also, product is not shown as in picture..They are just plain without any design pattern..Feeling cheated..

"
"

  Only one is open. It's original packet is thrown out.  The rest are in their original packets. From the photos attached herewith it can be seen that within 2/3days of use, the elastic & the stitching has completely worn out. It's within the period of return. So I want to return the entire products of 10 panties. I had got lots of faith on Rupa. I am devastated. Kindly mention can I return it? OR send me a genuine/original Rupa panties set.

"
"

  Good product. Long lasting, no colour leakage, material strong yet soft. Wash with hands and not in the washing machine, it will last long. Go for it.

"
"

  The only thing which could be better is colors, got 7 packets of same color., However, rest of the things like comfort, softness, and fitting is perfect...

"
"

  Was very unsure of buying this because of size issue and being non-returnable... but luckily there were no size problem. Expected slightly better material but its still good for the price.

"
"

  Instead of 10 panty i got 5 panty

"
"

  Rupa Jon cotton panty pack of 10 but what I have got 5 small box containing 1 in each box in the consignment, why ?? Money paid for 10 got 5 only which are not fit too. Poor service. Disappointed and have made my mind not to order any apparel from Amazon. Guys wait for shops to open outside then go, check and buy. Online shopping of apparel is waste of money only.

"
"

  Product recived good ,soft and very comfortable ,I suggest please choose right seller of highest rating but do not buy from seller  j s traders only purchase from seller cloudtail 👍

"
"

  I ordered this by reading previous reviews..There is a size issue.. I use 85cm n ordered 90cm...Plz go one size up with this product..Otherwise produtos good and comfortable..

"
"

  WORST PRODUCT. DO NOT BUY @$! Package seal was open. There are only 5 when the order says pack of 10. The material is satin instead of cotton. Return or refund has to be initiated by the seller.

"
"

  Dont buy if you have aciditing urine . The colour fade in that part

"
"

  Very disappointed. It came in plastic packs, not in rupa packs; does not have rupa’s logo anywhere. Completely local. And three came open, so i am disposing these off. Not going to wear these. Also, I received only 7 units, instead of 10.Highly disappointed. The seller is clearly fooling people.

"
"

  Perfect combo if anyone is searching for panties in combo go through this product it is amazing softness is great and shiny material too the colours are beautiful must buy itt

"
"

  Ordered this product thinking of valuefor money product. But disappointed when I received the package. It contained only 7 pieces, where on the order it's mentioned pack of 10. But Thanks to the Amazon for all its valuable support.

"
"

  I ordered xl size panties, I got all items Wrong & also non returnable,I throw it out.

"

   Really nice product and comfortable too but I give 4 star only because it's little bit cheating .In sale price 5 panty is in pack .4 panty is good in size and company name ""RUPA"" but 5th panty very small and no name on it.

"
"

  Best quality product and pricing is also acceptable not so high and the fabric useb by the manufacturer is the best quality fabric.

"
"

  Ordered with the seller cloudtell india, he is a trustworthy and send original Rupa brand products as mentioned.. Quick delivery....it’s cotton material and comfortable at this price.It comes with 10 individual Rupa boxes in a big Rupa Jon branded genuine box.

"
"

  I completely dislike this product because of its wrong size. And u are denying to return or exchange this product. In such cases what a customer will do please suggest. What I will do with 10 wrong sized products though I am a regular customer of Amazon

"
"

  The material is very soft and the elastic is inside the stiching so it doesn't poke. Fit is excellent and it is very comfortable to wear. Colours are dark and nice to wear during periods too. very affordable, good value for money and a great deal!

"
"

  Product is just okayBut never expected it from amazonIt is showing 10 pieces pack and delivered only 5Feel cheated. So i returned it

"
"

  Only 5 items received instead of 10......waste of money...... but the item is non returnable but we paid amount for 10 ........ Don't buy this product ... waste of money  ......... totally dispointed with this product and i won't shop this brand product again..... Waste........Don't buy this guys ........

"
"

  It's very comfortable and good product, I'm very happy to have it 😊 I suggest to every girl that please try that product at least one's, The product has very good Quality in a veryCheap Rate, compares to other brands like Jocky etc.

"
"

  I purchased this product as per advertisement. But I didn't get the parcel or product as per order. So I was compliant to your office. But I didn't get any kind of reply.

"
"

  The product quality is as expected but only 5 were delivered instead of 10. Kudos to amazon to respond quickly and refund the entire amount but numbers has to be checked before packing and shipping.

"
"

  This is local product, with local brand name..Cheap quality and not worth at all..You will get near by local shop with good quality better then this..Don't buy pls.. Amazon never check all this..

"
"

  First time I purchase these typo Penty and I love it 😻I have UTI issue so doctor suggest me to wear cotton Penty and it’s feels you relax

"
"

  It's all  same colour (meroon )

"
"

  product is very nice,but deliverd item is less than as per order,ie delivered package contained only 5 pieces out of 10 nos.so pls send balance 5 pieces without delay.

"
"

  Product size is smaller than standard panty sizeAlso quantity received is only 9nos. Instead of 10

  First time rupa product Quality is very poor I feel

"
"

  The product I recieved was in good condition. But after using these undergarment I got rashes all over the lower part of my body and legsI doubt that the material of the cloth is not good causing irritation as snd rashes I used two of them and have faced similar after using them. Want to return rest of the pieces. Is this is possible. if yes help me to return it and want refund.

"
"

  I bought Rupa Jones panties for the first time. I must say that I was apprehensive about buying it first, but trust me you won't regret buying these. Firstly they are economical, secondly they are very soft amd comfortable. I got all the ten panties of 10 different colours. I am happy with my purchase. The size that mentioned in the suze chart is accurate, so you can buy accordingly. Go for it.

"
"

  Product Quality is Found Okay.But Fit only issue.It's not exact XXL [100 Cm],While Full elasticity limit ,it Expand only 90~95Cm.Hence i want to go for the Free size.I just open one & ware.remaining are Company packed only.I request to exchange the 3XL or 4XL for the remaining 9 Packs.Pls Advise.Thanks & regardsKarthikeyan

"
"

  Item is good but received only 5 instead of 10, which was the offer, disappointed with the careless order handling, would like Amazon to return me half of the amount paid!! 🤷

"
"

  Product says XL, but is actually small size, and there is no return policy, so please be careful before ordering. The material for the cost given is good. But I had to give away for free since they could not fit the person

"
"

  It’s not Rupa Jon product.. and the quality is not that good.. but ok.. and it’s only 7 pieces not 10.. cheating

"
"

  Pros:1. Value for money.2. Soft and smooth fabric.3. Got different colours.Cons:1. But stitches opens after two/ three washes.

"
"

  The material is thin. It is very comfortable but may not last long.Reviewing again after 2 years: still perfect. Just the print has washed off. But these have lasted really, really long and will last for a long time to come.

"
"

  Good product but some panty stitching is coming out, if the stitching can be good then it will be good otherwise stuff is good.

"
"

  This is the second time I am buying this. It's worth the money, best quality price and size. No color fading after wash

"
"

  Thanks Amazon ... its a wonderful after sales service given by you. I got my refund. Products also very good. It's a value for money.I am bit delayed to give you feedback.

"
"

  Shrinks on washing. After few washes holes up. Not of good quality.

"
"

  Packaging was not good. It looked kind of damaged. Product does not fit even after I bought the next size of my previous order. So I bought twice and both do not fit.

"
"

  Wasn't pack of 10, as ordered only 8.-Quality and texture seems fine.-Fitting is apt, as per the sizes.-4 sets in pairs of 2(8)-Missing 1set , pair of 2.(blue)

"
"

  I did not receive Rupa Jon panties. Just some random brand. The material is not comfortable. The size is off, too large. The colour bleeds when washed. Disappointing!

"
"

  Dear sir today I received products. It is having only 4 panty whereas on order is mentioned pack of 10 panty. Please give 6 more panty or refund money. Quality of cloth is good but I received only 4 out of 10 panty.last year also received only 4  panty out of 10. I complaint to customer care but not respond......

"
"

  Got 10 panties just for Rs 315.Best deal.Material also soft and skin friendly.Comfortable and colour of the panties are also nice

"
"

  Now you will wonder when i gave 4 star for the product quality what the problem. The biggest problem is size. I ordered large and they delievred medium. And there is no way to  return or replace. So entire product is waste of money. Even though the quality is good. Its of no use to me.

"
"

  Very very bad  quality waste your money

"
"

  Product is good but funny thing is I ordered women’s panty but it turned out to be Men’s inner wear 🤣.. 10 piece for 315₹ money valued.

"
"

  यह प्रोडक्ट कीमत के अनुसार बहुत बढ़िया है, कम्फ़र्टेबल, कोमल है। कॉटन बढिया है। स्टैण्डर्ड साइज है। रंग भी बढ़िया हैं।

"
"

  This product is not at all stretchable, as mentioned in Rupa Jon Women's Cotton Panty (Pack of 10)(Colors May Vary)(JN ASH PLN PNTY-PO10_Assorted_100but received on 5 pcs, later have to ask for refund, which was initiated

"
"

  As shown in the pictures it is far more different. You will get different colours.. 10 pieces and 10 different colours. Wow.. Please select the correct size of your fit. Product quality is obviously good. I bought it for 299rs of L size.. Yes.. Don't think much.. A good quality product you can buy in minimum price. Thank you👍

"
"

  I am not happy for this product some pentys small some ok and 4 penty same colour nd 1 diffrent and all pentys after wash Fadede and after 1 day I am use this product see like this type of problem but one good quality of company product fitting size ok comfortable but I give u number 2 just fitting nd cloth was so soft that why 2/5

"
"

  Unfortunately 3 panties were missing only 7 were delivered

"
"

  About quality 💯 cotton and confortable, Size u should by next, bcz I purchased 100cm instead of 95cm, comparing some other brands. But worthy.....

"
"

  Material - SoftComfort - goodValue for money - yesBuy again? - yesRecommended to others - yesAfter all the research.! I finally found good product.! Thanks Amazon for saving lives in corona crisis

"
"

  We have received 6 items in total where as the product says 10 in display.Also each item has different sizes and moreover they are not rupa john..Stupid Vendor.

"
"

  Size bhi sahi nhi h or quality bhi money waste hai or ten peice likha h per five hi bejha hai not satisfied with this app

"
"

  There was only 6 pantiesUpdate..Not color fast. Seems like product made by training people during their stitching study days and simply put up for sale.Got holes and tears by 2nd week. All threads coming out by 3rd week

"
"

  I really like the stuff. Pure cotton . Soft.  But only thing disappointing here is they send 4 manly blue color panties which i gave to my mother. Lol .. she said she dont have any problem.  So if you dont have any issues with color just go for it without second thought.

   Utterly disappointedGot only 5,but was supposed to get 10,abnormal sizes

"
"

  The order quantity is for 10 & I have received only 5..The size odered was for 100 cms& I received 95cms.Quality seems poorer than previously ordered from this company...

"
"

  good comfortable products I feel it is pure cotton ok original product बुकिंग was successful I feel so after it

"
"

  No label or brand name on tag or on the product. Doesn't seem to be an original product.

"
"

  Waste of money. Don't buy, in the description it is mentioned pack of 10 but received only 8 that doesn't have any company name or size mentioned. Poor quality just like road side product. Very disappointed. I never expected such kind of products in Amazon.

"
"

  Received only 8nos instead of 10.The material is also not pure cotton, it is mixed with polystyrene. There is no logo of any brand.  But, It fits properly.

"
"

  I want to return this product as instead of 10, I received only 8 pieces and all of different sizes.some small,some big.horrible product and complete fraud as it is not Rupa Jon product.how to return?

"
"

  RECEIVED ONLY 5 INSTEAD OF 10...VERY DISAPPOINTED...PLZ DELIVER THE REMAINING 5

"
"

  Product is good but size is smaller than regular. I ordered 10 pieces combo but received only 8. So feels like cheated. Couldn't returns also. Received Different brand. If you ignore above issues than Overall ok product.

"
"

  Very worst product.also it quantity reduce after delivered.quality very poor.pls reqst others dont buy this product.These like product reduce name of  amazon like good online service...very poor...

"
"

  लूट  मचा रखी है ।10 की जगाह सिर्फ 4 भेजी।पैसे पूरे लीये,और सामान आधा भी नहीं भेजा।इनके reviews से ज़ाहिर है,हम एक्लौते, भुक्थ भोगी नहीं हैं ।they seem to be habitual  defaulters,cheaters.

"
"

  One of the worst product I’ve ever seen. Within two days of usage all threads are coming out from stitches. Absolutely pathetic stitching. Never expected this quality from such a reputed brand.

"
"

  Got only 7 instead of 10. The size seems a bit small too. There's no brand name on any of them....I think they have given me a local product instead of Rupa. Can't even return them back.😞

"
"

  I ordered 12 numbers in combo. After first wash small holes in this item. Then I check it  all are damage vand very thin . I am very disappointed.

"
"

  very poor deal. brand not mentioned in the item. received only 6 nos. instead of 10 as shown. return option not working. unable to return the item.

"
"

  Ordered and received in good condition. Items are good. Fabric is good and worth it. Thanks Amazon and Roopa brand

"
"

  Comfortable soft. Fits well. Value for money. But only 5 panties were delivered where as , placed order for pack of 10.

"
"

  Include the size in cms in size chart. I received only 7 nos...not 10 as mentioned in the product description. Feel have been cheated.Ok for the money.

"
"

  Quality is ok..not very good not very bad. One of the think which I didn't like is they sent all colours black and blue in pack of 10.

"
"

  Comfortable but very thin & I don't think it will lasts for long time (particulary for 1 panty)

"
"

  पेंटी का कपड़ा भी शॉप है और सभी डाक कलर अच्छे हैं जैसा सोचा था पैसा मिला अगर आप लोग को भी लेना है तो आप जा सकते हैं बहुत अच्छी चीज है

"
"

  Don't buy it just because of RUPA. The quality is ok as compair to price  but  same quality you will get from road side vendors

"
"

  The product stands for a good brand name..as well as in quality also..I bought my regular size and it was same..I like the product bcz of its comfortability and decent colors..and good in price range also..

"
"

  Do not ever buy this item even by mistake. There is no mention of size and product is too small and cheap. Additionally, I ordered 10 panties, they sent only 7 in the pack.

"
"

  Value for money. I'm planning to buy it again.

"
"

  the product is okay but i recieved only 5 units as the showed in product they are selling 10 but i recieved only 5 fraud not as same as showed ..........

"
"

  Product.which was delivery was completely different from the description. Quality, brand,size and quantity all were different.... kindly do not purchase it. Its completely fake product and the product which was delivered was very cheap and it is not returnable.How unfair is this.I request amazon to kindly ban such kind of sellers.

"
"

  Everything fitting wise is good,but not rupa product,there is no name stating it as rupa,and no print on the product,cloth is delicate

"
"

  Worst I just received 3 and are of small size and they are not exchanging do not buy it

"
"

  Good product as per rate... I had paid 400/- rs for all 10 piece. Little thick fabric but overall good. Brand name rupa & it's cool

"
"

  Ordered pack of 10.. but received 8 in a pack with poor quality.  There is no company emblem or anything.. simply put in a plastic cover

"
"

  Very good product at very low price... I had a doubt whether it would fit properly or would that be soft.... But the product is awesome with perfect fit... Absolutely, it, value for money....

"

   This is a pack of 10 . But I got only 4. It waste my money.and also this is not Rupa product.

"
"

  The size required is 3XL (105 CM )  But the items delivered do not fit.  This may please be replaced.  Thanks.

"
"

  I had ordered for pack of 10 but received only 5, i was not allowed to return the item as well. so be careful before ordering this. Highly disappointed 😞

"
"

  Nice in this price.But it's not like original.Ok ok for normal use

"
"

  Received only 5 pieces instead of 10. But the quality is good.And the MRP on the box is lesser than the price here..!

"
"

  Product was good but quantity was not as I expected. It was written 10 but I got only 3.please mention right quantity.

"
"

  As of now when i look at it its really good. Will have to see how long it lasts.

"
"

  I was ordered XL size but it's not fit for me.then i call them and request please exchange my product I want XXL size but they can't exchange.its 10 pic panty package I West my money.please make sure your size and then order it.

"
"

  I got pack of only 5 when it says pack of 10. And also the product is not as shown in the reference picture. The picture shows 10 pack of printed material but I  received pack of 5 plain ones.

"
"

  Quality and comfortable product with such dirt cheap price received 10 panties from Rupa Jon.. I could not asked for more in 300₹ with such nice fit and quality. Thanks Amazon and seller

"
"

  Larger than expected. Surely not 95 as per size given in iht edesc.

"
"

  Ordered 10 pantyBut received 5 only cheating

"
"

  Material quality is good but after one wash only threads will start coming out..

"
"

  I received pack of 5 not 10 though I paid the full amount....

"
"

  Comfortable Elastic that does not stop blood circulation & soft cotton

"
"

  The number of quantity is less. This is only pack of 6. I have ordered pack of 10.anf this is small in size. I want to return it. I m totally unsatisfied.

"
"

  Best panties i would say. Value for money. Quality is better than other expensive  brands.

"
"

  Poor quality sriching. Stixhed thread comes out on second day itself  of use and wash.  Less fabric thickness.  Hopefully the piece will be useless after a week and to put in dustbin. The brand fooling is for.money. shame on rupa.

"
"

  No

"
"

  Feathersoft cloth material.so comfortable.perfect fit.those who have sensitive skin best for them.superb.I got PAC of 12 On so reasonable price.thanks Amazon.

"
"

  Dear sir today I received products. It is having only 8 panty whereas on order is mentioned pack of 10 panty. Please give 2 more panty or refund money. Quality of cloth is good but I received only 8 out of 10 panty. size is also small , I ordered for 100cm but I received 90 cm

"
"

  Dont buy it.it is too small that i m giving to my daughter ..as it not replaceble...returnable . ..i ordered xxl and received kid size...even logo showing on image was absent....there was no size tag on it which usually present at any garment...seller cheated me ....please dont buy...

"
"

  Very bad product..These are not product of Rupa..no sticker of Rupa.,no size mentioned. you send local product. very cheap products.  so disappointed.  How could u do this to ur regular customer. Don't purchase this item. Waste of money. I want to return this product.

"
"

  The product is a bit tight, not that soft and  colour comes off while washing. Given the cost, an ok bargain

"
"

  The product recieved waz pooja brand ( not even heard about this brand)not rupa .. and there waz only 8 pieces not 10. I wouldn't have given even one star . No star is what I wanted to give

"
"

  I ordered pack of 10 but in the package there were only 5

"
"

  First buy. Great price for 10. Soft. Comfortable. Let's hope colour does not come off...... with time

"
"

  Received different product instead of the one ordered.  Cheap quality panties of unknown brand and that only 5 in number.

"
"

  The colours are dark and comfy to wear. Smooth texture and color fast washes. The stitches are also fine

"
"

  Overall in this price range material and items are in good, but before buying choose the exact size n order,...sizes are slightly differ from branded like jockey, enamor....

"
"

  This is a Very Good Excellent & quality product . I'm very happy about this thing, received in the less than MRP printed to packet of unit in Box .

"
"

  Why people are giving wrong reviews.... it's comfortable and delivered as it shown genuine product

"
"

  ISS product par to dill khus kar diya bhaiAwesome product

"
"

  it is a cheap normal item, in term of quality, nothing special

"
"

  I ordered a set of 10 but received only a set of 5 so.......quality is good according to price it is oky

"
"

  Very poor product west of money

"
"

  Received product as expected ! Quality of the colth is good, packing also done properly !

"
"

  V bad quality and fit. Came one less in number. Extremely uncomfortable.

"
"

  The product seems ok but the six=ze is not as expected . it is mentioned xl but when we recd it it seems to be much lesser . hence we are asking for replacement but unfortunately even amazon says non refundable . Surprising.

"
"

  I ordered this and I received only 7 pieces and cheap quality of some local brand not rupa as shown ,small in size and 5 of them are same colored even transparent...please don't buy ....you will definitely waste your money ....very disappointed

"
"

  Wrong product. It's not Rupa but some local. Do not match as shown. Poor quality

"
"

  Don't buy this product, I received fake brand not roopa brand and i received only 5pcs so plz don't buy.

"
"

  Actuall Pack should be 10 piece but it consists only 5 piece. Very bad experience. Seriously I didn't expect this from Amazon shopping.. dat to cloth quality was very cheap. Untrusted product

"
"

  Even I don't want give a single star also... This is a big fraud 😡😡😡 in the description box they have mentioned u LL get 10 pieces but they LL give only 5 and quality my God it's horrible and also they l give some cheap brand.... I suggest not to buy

"
"

  The print wash out in first wash. Please ensure the product as per brand name.

"
"

  I got this product at very low price 364 and I was wondering how the manufacturing company can provide with such a low price(without any profit margin). quality is good.

"
"

  Useless product. Torn and very small size . Has several holes in it.

"
"

  Wrost item.. order for 10 n give 5 only. Very dissatisfied from Amazon .. as we r the very old customer

"
"

  Don’t buy this product on the basis of photo. It’s very bad quality product. It is not good at all. The product is very different from the pic which is shown. Street market products have more quality than this. They are big scammers.

"
"

  I never bought such an inferior quality product in my life,it teared after 2 - 3 washes , will never forget the name RUPA

"
"

  THE PRODUCT INFO SAYS 10...I RECIEVED ONLY AND ONLY 5...ALSO THE REVIEW PICS SHOW THAT THEY RECEIVED IN ONE BOX ASSORTED IN 10 OF SMALLER ONES.....QUALITY IS FINE....NOT RECOMMENDED

"
"

  It is not from brand Rupa. It is just a local inners. Worst experience. Amazon, stop making fool to people.

"
"

  No. of product received 05 against shown 10 in advertise.there is no action...after getting information from customer...why r u not taken any action??? I got only 5 pieces instead of 10...why ??

"
"

  I bought this product , When it was 416/- for 10 pieces. Yesterday i received this product. But yesterday the price was 389/- 😢After using i will update my review again.

"
"

  Supposed to get 10,received only 5.As it not returnable, I felt cheated. Very disappointing. How could I get back remainings?

"
"

  In description mentioned 10 pieces but sent only four items

"
"

  Very nice product....I am very much satisfied with this product...value for money.It has cost only 400 for 10 pcs.that means each cost 40 approx.Everybody must try....Soft 100% pure cotton breathable panties with double layer....

"
"

  I have ordered this combo (of 10 pieces) but i received only 8 pieces...Feeling like i have been cheated....It is not the right gesture....And as it is not the item which is eligible for return, i have no option to exchange or return it...

"
"

  Soft but somewhat smaller than it mentioned..

"
"

  Too good and value for money. Branded product.  Fantastic experience and timely delivered.

"
"

  It doesn't fit me soo i want to return i have tried one of them if u say i ll keep that one and please take this return please it ll be use less for me now

"
"

  Please try to keep all ten in black color.  Some people don't like wearing colorful panties.

"
"

  Got only 5 panties.what the hell is this???I paid for 10 and got only 5..I want amazon to send me remaining 5..

"
"

  Cloth quality not reach our expectation. Improve product quality over all product OK

"
"

  The product is soft and comfortable . Machine washable no running colours . The product fit as expected .

"
"

  While ordering, it was written pack of 10, but received only 5 items.The product received is of another brand too.

"
"

  It was good but not a Rupa brand. There was no brand name specified anywhere nor it was packed in any branded box. They were simply packed in plastic. The color doesnt run and fitting is fine. But threads are coming loose.

"
"

  Worst product in this whole world... Booked for 10 but received only 5 .. Worst experience with Amazon never going to place order again.. Amazon your quality of work is getting Detoriated please look into this matter..

"
"

  Product is very good according to the price 👌

"
"

  Product is not a rupa brand. It is local and very poor quality. Receipt qty 6 only agst booked 10.We are feeling very bad and not recommended for any other person.Return policy is not available for this product.

"
"

  I was written pack of 10 , I ordered but received only 5 packs , that's so wrong and also the size I ordered was XL but received L

"
"

  Fabric quality is poor..

"
"

  Quality  is  best  super  quality  fit  as  expected  nice

"
"

  Gets torn very soon. Threads started coming out after couple of wash

"
"

  Rupa is a standard company and I like their product.

"
"

  My order got delivered today and I have only received 5 packs of panties. But it is shown that it has 10 panties. I want the order 5 panties to be delivered for which I have already paid.

"
"

  Got only 8 Panties. Never go it, not any rupa john quality delivered.Waste of money, better purchase spending more money and go for the best one.

"
"

  Wakwas dlquality stiches are coming out in very easily very cheap material of cloth and thred for stiching.

"
"

  Comfort but when it come it's only seven product say  ten panty u give only seven panty

"
"

  XL is smaller than medium! Could not use it.

"
"

  Not Rupa, a different item got delivered. Poor quality, very thin material of a poor brand. It doesn't have a return option also.

"
"

  I liked the product,but i demanded combo of 10pcs.but i got 5pcs.The size is  what i demanded for.

"
"

  I got only 5 panty in a combo of 10...Customer service is zero..Quality is poor..Pathetic service..So disappointed

"

  It have paint not print which wash off after two three wash and panty becomes plain

"
"

  Not that much comfortable

"
"

  Great for regular use. Nothing fancy. Very comfortable. Doesn't fit smugly. Breathable fabric. Value for money. Not a great option when wearing a pad. But a great option for regular days.

"
"

  Description says 10 units however received just 9Overall quality is ok

"
"

  Really such a great product in reasonable price.

"
"

  It's very soft and perfect fit. Perfect cotton and value for money. Thank you Amazon.

"
"

  Different brand,only 5 piece received.......bad experience

"
"

  Got the product of another company

"
"

  Size ok. Bad stitching. Stitching starts to come apart even after first wash which is pretty disappointing.

"
"

  The product is very comfortable... Fabric is very soft and stretchable... Easy to wash.. Overall loved it

"
"

  Quality averagebut seller supply only 8 instead of 10.and it don't returndue to policy.this is very bad experience.

"
"

  Nice quality and durability. Good fabric. Price is also very affordable.

"
"

  Can't expect anything better at this price.

"
"

  Product is good. But give 1 star because i received only 7 units. How irresponsible. Dear Amazon work on it. Sometimes we don't have time to return. Otherwise product is absolutely good. Go for it.

"
"

  Product was not good, 2 of them are teared. I didn't like the product and will not recommend it.

"
"

"
"

  Comfort.Smaller size.Please order size 95 if someone  want size  85.Excellent fabric.No colour bleeding of the fabric.

"

  Even though it show correct size in packet but it's too small. Quality also not good. It leaves color at 1-2 wash.

"
"

"
"

  Comfy but threds coming off

"
"

  Received 5 from the pack of 10, what i have to do

"
"

  The size was small and the quality is very very poor not as per the image and got only 8 not 10.Don't purchase it very low quality product

"
"

  Bad product

"
"

  Quality is good. It is comfortable, feels soft, colour also look good. Size is proper as mentioned.

"
"

"
"

"
"

  Waste products

"
"

  quality and stitching very bad. Cloth is very thin:(Damaged after 2months use... specially its stiching... it will ripe easily

"
"

  It’s useful and comfortable.

"
"

  Very bad quality for a branded product. Don't buy this.

"
"

  Very poor quality

"
"

  Not good quality,very thin cloth mattereal

"
"

  I had ordered XL size but, L size was delivered to me. Hence, I applied for return but, it is showing, ""Your product isn't eligible for a return"". So, please don't order this product; if not suitable, you can't return or replace it. Thank you.

"
"

  Good product

"
"

  value for money, cloth is very comfortable, not leaving color, satisfied with quality

"
"

  Ordered for Rupa John and got Lux karishma. Well, not complaining because it's fits good, quality n colours are not bad. Need to wash n see though. The leastics are not too tight which is also good.

"
"

  The material is thinner than one bought from local market but for the price paid it can be compromised. Seller was Cloudtail and bought a set of 10 for just Rs 299/-. Good for use and throw types.

"
"

  Mentioned 10 panties but received only 5.pl clarify .

"
"

  Sorry to say ordered quantity received less.Received 5 panty instead of 10. Inside boxes were containing one panty in each of 5 boxes. Please inquire for necessary action.

"
"

  Rupa is a good brand...

"
"

  Very comfortable.. nd quality of clothe is vry good.. 100% cotton..

"
"

  Received only 6. Material is also quite thin. Let's see how durable they are... order a size larger

"
"

  Pretty good for the money

"
"

  The fit isn't that good.

"
"

  Instead of ten pcs received only eight pcs. And when I tried to return it shows "" this item is not eligible for return""PatheticSize is also small

"
"

  4 out of 10 are little bit larger.. Eventhough they are packaged for the size 85

"
"

  Ordered for 100cm size, but received 90 cm size product very unhappy waste of money

"
"

  Ordered pack of 10 panties and get only 5

"
"

  Ok for the price.shrink after wash try to buy one bigger size than usual.

"
"

  Nice packing, neat and  clean

"
"

  Please u have to give 10 pants already u have mentioned there. But why u r given 8 paints. Refund my 2 paints money..

"
"

  Ordered a box for the second time. Nice material and stitching. The colours are also good but it would be great if lighter shades are also available.

"
"

  Softness and comfort

"
"

  उत्पाद संख्या में कम प्राप्त हुआ। इसकी शिकायत की गई, किंतु कोई उत्तर प्राप्त नहीं हुआ।।

"
"

  Purchase one size large , quality good.very reasonable cost.

"
"

  Nice one

"
"

  Product is okay but received only half wheather paid for double

"
"

  I paid for 10 and received only 5 panties totally disappointed and in pic it is printed in real it's plain stop cheating customers . I am prime member even

"
"

  After 2 uses the thread is out, elastic is out  and it’s tearing … price is reasonable but product not worth wearing them

"
"

  I recvd only 5 piece n this is from different brand n size is also different

"
"

  I have ordered 10 panties of XL size but received only 5 and all are of different sizes.Cloth is ok ok. But overall product is not worth it.

"
"

  Ordered 10 pcs but receive only 5 pcs

"
"

  Got Original product with Good quality at Reasonable Price

"
"

  When I opened packing, I got only five pieces of panties in place of Ten pieces of panties. Why it is  so? Send remaining five panties after that I will give feedback.

"
"

  Product fit ok...but we ordered 10 pack.but seller sent 5...but Amazon executive reslove our issue...

"
"

  Wrong size delivered, moreover only 5 items were delivered

"
"

  Very disgusting,,,,,ordered ten PCs 95cm,,ten PCs 90 CMS,,,received only five pcs of 95 CMS,,,ridiculous,,,,,the genuine brand Amazon must enquire ,,,,otherwise,,,,you will lose valuable customers like me,,,,,,,on a serious note,,,,

"
"

  Item is good bt sending half item

"
"

  Value for money

"
"

  This is bad 😔 you said it has pack of ten but at the time I'have opened  thiis pack then it contains only seven this is really cheating

"
"

  बहुत ही अच्छा है

"
"

  It's a simple sobar nice comfortable product ibhave used for post pregnancy days to have relaxed /comfortable breathable clothes

"
"

  Not very comfortable and fit. Elastic is not very good

"
"

  Comfortable and good product

"
"

"
"

  Awesome productI loved itSo muchGo for it

"
"

  Average quality

"
"

  The size were different for 4 itemsThe seller is just trying to get rid of its unsold material

"
"

  I ordered for 10 panties but I received only 5 panties for Rs. 419 something ........very very disappointed

"
"

  Good fit .. soft and comfortable.. recommended

"
"

  Quality cotton, elastic is good too. Would recommend. however go for plus 1 size more.

"
"

  Good

"
"

  Size is not on par with benchmark standards. For instance if you take 90cm it will be 70cm. Size is written only on box not on original product. I flet completely cheated twice.

"
"

  Very good quality. Kids will enjoy using it.

"
"

  Well good texture

"
"

  Good product, very soft n comfort value for money, I recommend to all

"
"

  This product is not at all  as it is shown in the picture. It says a pack of 10 but I received only 5 of these. That too were not as shown in the pictures. ""DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT""

"
"

  Stitched treads are coming out by it's own.. also getting holes after 2 to 3 time  wash.

"
"

  look like gents wear. dont buy

"
"

  Quality Of the Product is Good

"
"

  Dissatisfied with the product.  Such dealers give bad name to amazon by supplying different to what they say .that 24inch/60cm is supplied against order of 38inch/100cm see photo .

"
"

  only 5  was instead of 10. need the rest of the 5. why it is scamming people ?

"
"

  It's a good product. Quality could be a bit better though, Fabric is a little thin. Fitting is perfect, its comfortable wear. But overall for the money paid, its descent product. I'd say go for it

"
"

  Good...

"
"

  Like

"
"

  Only 5 was delivered though the product says 10. And since this is a non refundable product unable to raise a ticket too.

"
"

  quality and stiching is very poor dont buy this product ,the elastic is gone after one day use very poor quality

"
"

  Every thing is good but we received 8 nos only  of pack.Above showing order pack of 10Where is the problem we don't knowPlease not to repeated other customers .

"
"

  Good according to price but cloth quality is low

"
"

  Seems to be a really good product at cheap price..

"
"

  Got only 5 instead of 10

"
"

  I have purchased 10 pc of this product but received only 5 pc. Kindly look into the matter.This type of falls commitment not acceptable at all.

"
"

  Quality and fit not at all good

"
"

  its good

"
"

  Very good quality. Good price, comfortable.Very satisfied.

"
"

  Awesome fitGood fabricVery economical

"
"

"
"

  Product was good but I got only 5 panties instead of 10 so got disappointed

"
"

  Very good quality, ordered L(90cm)size seems to be a bit bigger than expected.

"
"

  Very worst, poor quality, n size also...

"
"

  I heave received only 5  instead of 10 in a pack of Rupa Jon Women's Cotton Panty (Pack of 10)(Colors May Vary)(JN ASH PLN PNTY-PO10_Assorted_100/XX-Large). Please send me missing nos at an earliest

"
"

  This product is just awesome 100% cotton and colours are brilliant....I got 10 in only 414 rs....really worth it😍😍

"
"

  I feel it is cheating as 2 empty boxes are packed in the pack of 10. There is no way we can claim it once it is opened so I feel they take advantage of it

"
"

  I recieved only 5

"
"

  Very reasonable and good quality product.

"
"

  I got total 10 different colours than shown in the image. I have tried one and found comfortable so i ordered the set.

"
"

  Local product WapasDispatch Amazon office product no

"
"

  The product is too good,  very much satisfied and liked it. A big Thumbs Up to the product 👍.

"
"

  I feel cheated as i have received only 5pkts of panties, suppose to be 10 nos. Otherwise it could be 10/10 in terms of quality...now i m not even able to contact for help

"
"

  Amazing.. 420rs  for 10 panties.. vlaue for money.. it's very soft and good quality of material.

"
"

  Good product

"
"

  Very poor quality, and its not a brand of Rupa.. even road side material is good compared to this.. and size also delivered wrong.. worst product.. I want to return this item but not accepting

"
"

  COmfortable and affordable.

"
"

"

"
"

  Really amazing product at best price.

"
"

  Good quality. But from back side little small in size not covering back fully.

"
"

  I have had a very bad experience with Amazon Shopping yet & I have found different brand product mentioned to in and irregular size and proportions. I am very disappointed with this service.

"
"

  I ordered L size but received kids size. Very poor quality. It is shown 10 pieces but received only 7 items. Very thin n transparent. Low Cheap quality. ..

"
"

  The seller should provide a size chart

"
"

  Poor quality....

"
"

  Product is good, quality is also nice... But the detail page is missleading. It's actually pack of 8, which I received.

"
"

  Stichting quality is not up to the mark, need improvement

"
"

  I ordered for Rupa brand but got product branded Pooja. Its seems like local product, stiches are coming off.

"
"

  The comfort and softness is great. It fits perfectly. Very great floral periods too.

"
"

  Great fit and comfortable!

"
"

  Nice and gud price

"
"

  Quality was good ... Worth for the money...

"
"

  Fit an comfort is good but worst buy since one wash all stiches come off and itl be uncomfortable to wear after that.. stictches are too lose and ware off with single wash..

"
"

  While the quality of the cloth material is good, the stitching is of poor quality.

"
"

  Ok

"
"

  good product , but i will received only 6 quantities. But in order description there is 10 quantities written . So please provide me  the left 4 pcs .

"
"

  nice, good onemust buybut colours do vary

"
"

  Received 5 only instead of 10.  Not very good qualit..

"
"

  quality is gud but recieved only 5 i ordered 10

"
"

  I had ordered a pack of 10 but when I opened the pack found only 5 pieces of panties kindly see into the matter don't not buy this product waste

"
"

  10 different colours , love themMaterial softElastic is goodNice purchase ☺️👍

"
"

  I didn't received the same product .there was only 7 panties .also it was not of the same as shown in the picture

"
"

  It is not a original rupa brand product. this is fake product.  And the quality of the product is absolutely poor. Please do not buy this product.

"
"

  It s not Rupa product, ordinary from Street side material...fake product

"
"

  Material is good and size as expected.Overall satisfied.

"
"

  Quality is very good. No doubts on that. But, I received only five. The order says ten. Please look into this.Two stars have been cut because of the packing issue..

"
"

  Bad product...stitching is too bad

"
"

  Overall very good product.I baying 3 time in different size for my family values for money product.

"
"

  I ordered the product of  rupa jon and i got it of some another brand and even the quantity was less and it was of so poor material. I am totally unhappy with the product

"
"

  Pls don't buy the quality is so bad that the inner threading stitches came off after the first use before wash. Rupa has to main good quality  otherwise  will lose its name.

"
"

  Received wrong product

"
"

  All items are of smaller size and product from roadside with no value for money of the customer. It is total arrogance

"
"

  It's value for money. Fits well. Durable. The fabric is not the best quality but I guess that makes up in the price.

"
"

  All stitching opened after 1 wash.It seems like duplicate Rupa, or Rupa has not caring on this brand- Jon

"
"

  nice product

"
"

  The material is very soft and comfortable. It fits well. Good options for darker colors.

"
"

  Softness and value for moneyPack of 10 has to come but delivered only 8 .required explanation  and also kindly exchange item with pack of 10 and with size 85cm

"
"

  Nice

"
"

  Good

"
"

  The Product listed pack of 10 panties but I received only 2 items instead of 10. Also there is no brand name and quality is very poor. Moreover, it's not returnable.

"
"

  Good product.Lasts long.Fabric is good.not very fancy but quality is good at this price range

"
"

  Item as described. Good quality elastic. Comfortable cotton fabric.

"
"

  It was mentioned that 10 pieces will be delivered but only 5 pieces delivered,feeling cheated.

"
"

  I recieved only 5 pieces instead of 10 pieces  and delivered as expected

"
"

  Quantity is wrong i got 6 panty,quality is really bad and this is the product of some kanha blooms not of rupa jons and it also doesnt fit me,

"
"

  Soft and good fabric.Composition of dark colours, just the way I wanted.Recommended

"
"

  I got only 5.10days over, they r not returning money.

"
"

  Very very very good cloth and excellent value for money best product

"
"

  Quality and comfort wise ok. But colour loss is found during 5-6 initial washes. Though it’s not faded.

"
"

  This item is misleading. They say it is pack of 10 but I received only 5 items. Cheating customers by writing incorrect description.

"
"

  Only 5pack...very bad service....

"
"

"
"

  I ordered as I saw 10 pieces of panties but I received only 5 pieces of panties. Size also not as I want.very disappointed.

"
"

  Showing 10 pieces, but sending only 5 pieces

"
"

  Soft woven with nice fabric

"
"

  Very good standard. Fits nice. Cloth quality also good

"
"

  Worst product & service.We have ordered X larger size for 10 pieces, however we got only 5 piece and that too very small size, even kids can't wear,  Quality of the material is very worst

"
"

  It was just as I aspected quality was good but only one complaint that instead of 10 piece I only received 5, but the Amazon service was very good and they refunded the amount.

"
"

  Product is worst.. and also items are missing.. it is said that pack of 10 but only 5 received.. even though raised the complaint.. its not responded till now

"
"

"
"

"
"

  This product is very cheap and I get this product without any brand, here it is mentioned that this is Rupa Brand's product. And the most important thing is that no return policy is available.

"
"

  I have ordered 100 size but I received 85 , this item in non returnable. I am upset cause simply I am loosing money for some other person's (package person) mistake. But the Cloth is good.

"
"

  Size is smaller. Not comfortable

"
"

  Good value for money at Rs 48 per piece

  I ordered this product, where it described pack of 10. But received only 5 panties. But received full refund amount.

  I received a pack of 5 only. I ordered the pack of 10. Very disappointed.

"
"

  Instead of Rupa they gave me some 'mansi' brand's product. Instead of 10 I received just 5 of them that too the quality is cheap and it is surely not cotton..Guys please don't buy.

"
"

  I received only 5 out of 10 panties.

"
"

  It's okay

"
"

  Got the Original Rupa brand product as shown as in the picture including 10pcs inside the box. About product and product delivery was very nice.

"

  Product quality good and fits perfectly.

"
"

  The top is exactly of the cloth I expected and the colour too.. I am very much satisfied with my shopping over here ☺️ such services increases the believe to buy online in moderate prices

"
"

  I don't find stuff comfortable, lookwise ok but doesn't look good on me, May b gud for slim. Ones i have belly problem and it is highlighting belly part

"
"

  The product is good but the sleeves were too big in size..I would need to get it tailored a little.

"
"

  Beautiful Top go for it, thanks Amazon

"
"

  Colour combinations were nice but the fabric was not what I imagined from picture.If it would have been that Fabricon what it’s looks in picture, would loom awesome….

"
"

  The fit of this top is really good and the colours as well. Only thing i don't like are the tassels on the sleeves.

   Bought for my wife. Perfectly fit and good material

"
"

  Look wise good.Clothing material very comfortable.Only n biggest problem is it's neck size. It's too small that felt very tight. So I had to get it altered.

"
"

  Beautiful and comfortable

"
"

  There was nothing good in the product apart from its bright colour... It's small in length, sleeves look awkward and poorly stitched.. definitely not for medium size girls.. overall price should not have been more than 200..

  I like the unique color combination and it turned out to be fantastic on meComing to the size i bought xs and it fitted me perfect it will only require alterations if you are smaller than xs as wellOtherwise go for your size the dress is comfortable as well as stylishI wore it to a reception at 8 degree temperature the material is quite warm it will not work in summersBut rest everything thing just perfect ♥️♥️♥️

"
"

  The cloth ia very nice. Slides smoothly. The salwar material n stitch is also nice. The dupatta has a fine golden lace and tassels on four corners. Beautiful colour too. Loved it

"
"

  Fit as aspects

"
"

  It's a good suit , I recieved many compliments...

"
"

  This is such an elegant piece of clothing.. I can rate it 10/10..Perfect fit...Great colour and designComes with a nice ankle length pants and the dupatta is the best part of it.. just loved it

"
"

  Happy with this too much... product is too similar as image shown ... quality is also very good...may be because of camara colour got changed slightly , but it is exact as shown....worth buy...thank you ...janasya☺️  will definitely buy from your collection again 😊

"
"

  Seller is giving top, pant along with dupatta for 990 bucks.. What more can you ask for!!? Same dress is available on Myntra for 1700 rupees.. I'd say its a steal.. The only drawback in the dress is no inner lining which does not look flattering.. Otherwise the print and the color are exactly like the pic..dupatta is also good with a fine gold border lace..Updating after 3 washes..color bleeds a little..so first wash should be dry clean..but overall doesn't fade away..glad I bought it..

"
"

  Just loved the suit, wasnot able to go for shopping in lockdown purchased this for rakhi, and I love it.Got size S and fits me perfectly, here are my vitals if anybody is confused about size,,,  chest -34,  waist -30 height5'2 bit long for me because of height but yes it is anarkali so it's perfect.Must buy

"
"

  For 1200 got Kurti pant and dupattasize is big so go for a smaller size than what u normally buyIt's synthetic so only for cool  weather not summerGood finish on the stitchesLong umbrella styleLooks plain at the back of KurtiElastic waist little tight for me

  Not good it's too cheap it look too cheap. The quality of dhuptta is good. But the colour Nd quality of Kurta is too bad do not buy this product it's not worth for the price.

"
"

  Its more beautiful than picture.Comfortable,new color,good color combination,print is also very good.Problem is only with dupatta,its not manageable,dont know more about fabric still it looks like cheap georgette fabric.I bought M size but its little loose on me but i will manage.Overall,u can go for it for coming festival days...it will give u new look🙂

"
"

  What a Cloth it is!I 😍 this  dress.Shifon duppata is too good & length is also big.I bought this dress on Diwali 2019.I wore this at least 3-4 times.  Everyone one appreciates this dress.After wasing design doesn't gone.

"
"

  The material is pure rayon. Very soft and comfortable to wear. The colour is not blue but turquoise and it looks very good on fair people. Dupatta colour is perfect matching. Overall must buy product within this price range.

"
"

  The cloth is not cotton but looks very good after putting on. Fitting is as expected. The color is not too vibrant but soothing and easy on the eyes.The cloth seems wrinkle free and have a good fall because of its heavyness.Have  large prints but not too gaudy, looks decent though.Better if priced near to 650 to 700.A good buy though.

"
"

  Gorgeous and fashionable it has unique eye catching quality at the given price. Perfect for gifting and after a little fitting done its a headturner for sure. I will only ask the makers to improve the fabric quality and this will be a signature suit for them to sell. Why stay average!

"
"

  Like this material so much...  good fittings..  material is soft but not summer friendly..  delivery on time..  looks exactly like shown..  over all very nice product and usable for any occation...

"
"

  Lovely suit, so good fitting and in such a reasonable price. I purchased when the price is 700/-.. and I am so happy to have this.

"
"

  I loved the suit. The material is really good. The kurti is kind of flowy and hides your little belly fats. The pant is just the right fitting and the dupatta color is soothing and lovely, which gives a good contrast to the suit's color. I ordered medium size and it fits me perfectly.

"
"

  I bought this dress for Diwali and thought need to do some alteration, but after receiving the product i was shocked to see that the measurement is perfectly fitting to me and even the cloth material is very good. more over for people who regularly order XXL can fit to XL in this material

"
"

  First size is perfect, quality of the material is superb, kurta prints color and quality is same as shown, pant is perfect fit, dupatta is good. Kurta height is good that it suits perfect for 5'6 above girls, below that height pants are not much visible especially for 5' to 5'4..

"
"

  The dress is really superb!! It is same as shown in the pic. The fitting is so perfect and comfortable. The material is not super thick but yes it is not at all transparent. Only thing is, it is little lengthy for me, have to get it altered. Also, buy one size larger than your actual size.

"
"

  It seems  as it is already used as strains of vegetable found at two places in front pi f kurti. Feeling cheated and I am extremely disappointed from this kind of service of Amazon. Going to return 😬😬😬

"
"

  Nice quality

"
"

  The material is very good and fitting also is perfect. The pant is above ankle and looks classy...the dupatta is slightly small in size and one has to take it on either side only....overall, its a value for money...worth every penny...

"
"

  Product looks good but no inner attached it's too transparent can't way thasway returnd

"
"

  The material is rough and is not suitable for summer. But the thickness of the material, quality of the print and colour is good and is as shown in the image. Reasonable to pick it up for the price.

"
"

  Quality is good.But suite is round at bottom.Pant is simple.Dupptta is nice but heavily dark in colour.If any one is 5 feet 4 inch , She should choose small size.

"
"

  Excellent!!!If you really wanna buy this.. Juz go for it without any second choice.. The quality of fabric is sooo soft and quite comfortable.Thanks to Janasya and Amazon!!I am super excited to wear it now!!

"
"

  Worth the money.Albeit, sizing was a little larger than expected given I’m an XS size, still, with a little alteration, it fits perfectly.The golden design may fade off a little if you put perfume on it, I dunno why that happened, but it’s not too much, so it’s fine. 3

"
"

  It's a perfect dress for simple functions or festival's. I just loved it's fitting & colour combination.❤️ I have bought size m. I like it's pants as it's plain colour you can use it on different kurties as well 😍😍

"
"

  A value for money buy. The dress is same as displayed on website. Quality, colour, print all remains as it is even after multiple wash. A must buy product.

"
"

  This product is amazing and comfortable just for it. Suit set is affordable and party wear.The only changes I had to make was I removed the collar since it didn't suit me well which is not a problemJust go for it 😊

"
"

  This product is too large for a small size. Looks like a maxi dress with no cutouts as per image shown. Think before you buy. Returned this but still waiting for my money

"
"

  Nice product... Material is smooth n comfortable... I'm gonna check more on this and buy.. Loved it

"
"

  Best purchase on amazon, suitable for functions as well. Gives it a heavy look. Totally worth. However, refer size chart before purchasing, size is big, I generally go for M but S fitted me perfect

"
"

  Very good product...Happy with this..Thickness also very good, smooth and soft.

"
"

  Material is very good.It looks good on me.Fitting n stitching both are good.

"
"

  This dress is best ever.fabric, material, softness, richnesses, quality everything simply superbb. I would just suggest that please go for this product without any hesitation. Love you amazon and thank you so much for your outstanding performance. ❤️❤️❤️

"
"

  💚Beautiful pattern.💚Soft fabric.💚Exactly as shown in the picture.💚Color combination looks elegant.💚Highly recommended.💚Perfect fit.❤️Pant slightly short in size.❤️Little bit defect on dupatta.❤️100% polyester, so cannot wear in hot summer.💚Overall awesome.

"
"

  Oo my god I am soooo happy with this my hubby give me surprise and I love this suit.color is awesome,fitting is perfect, fabric is soo soft..I recommended for every one.😊😊

"
"

  ..(now Sasu-maa also asking for same suite)😂Value for money...everyone liked it....good softbmaterial...good fitting Pant...goos stitching ...Overall 10/10

"
"

  This is the first time I'm putting review in Amazon, since I want to praise the good work. In one word I can say that this dress is more than worth to your money. Color, look, comfort , fitting everything is superb. Waiting for few more designs from Janasya.

"
"

  Worst quality of product,did not like the print and quality of cloth very very poor, actually I brought it after reading so many good reviews but I wonder how this many people liked this product, kurta is very long which is covering full pant and fitting is not at all satisfactory, did not like anything of dress so returning back

"
"

  Im in love with this dress , no color bleeding and same as the image. the cloth is superb and brought it for my birthday. It made my day.

"
"

  We got it as a gift for my birthday. Beautiful Suit. Color looks vibrant and cloth is amazingly soft. Looks great as an Ocassion wear. I loved it. It's really worth every penny being charged. Great work!

"
"

  Kurti and Bottoms are same as shown in pic but I received a cotton blended dupatta whereas the picture shows silk or chiffon dupatta which I don’t like. Wanted to return but my sister liked it and kept it.

"
"

  This dress is too good... good quality material... good print.... long dupatta...  much better than expected..... 5 ☆

"
"

  Good one..But slight tight at waist area.colour was coolCloth quality ok ok.chunni was too good.

"
"

  Its so perfectly fitting as if tailor made. The material is soft,good quality, the gold print is also excellnt. The dupatta is so long..and the colour combination is so stunning..Indigo with peach...perfect party wear!

"
"

  Love the materialSame as picture

"
"

  - Same as shown.- Looks elegant and beautiful.- A bit loose some stiching required.- Comfortable to wear.- A good buy.

"
"

  I didnt like this outfit and it didnt suit on my body type. although i like the colour but one have to alter and it will look good on fair skin tone and who have long body structure.

"
"

  Color is nice, material is soft rayon. I purchased for the dupatta and like the color combination. Good product for small functions. I like it.

"
"

  Fabric is looking transparent .. quality is gud..looks gud.. price is good..

"
"

  The gown is too long for Small size. I have to go for alteration.

"
"

  It’s worth money!!! Beautiful neckline,Over all quality was good...and it is fit to it’s size...But not sure about the gold print on the top,this is the first time i wore!!

"
"

  Really osm product ... Really so soft n comfort to wear and mainly the dupatta is big n soft ... Thank u so much ...worth for money 💰

"
"

  I ordered xxl size in this suit.. the pants came the right size.However, the shirt size is clearly smaller!! It seems like a M or L. KINDLY replace it with the correct one as the suit looks awesome and cloth is also nice. I dont know whom to get in touch regarding this.

"
"

  This is such an amazing product. It fits so well just as mentioned in the size chart. It looks so beautiful after wearing and the material used is also good. Go for this if you are looking for a good option for yourself or if you want to gift it to someone

"
"

  Awesome kurti and straight pants ....cloth quality is very good....colur and everything is same as shown in image....very comfortable...and give classy look.

"
"

  Superb item..too good quality of top n bottom,duppatta is OK OK. But for this price the whole product,material,look,style,stitching everything is just wow!!

"
"

  It's so good item. Great product in the low budget.Every one suprised with great product quality, beautiful looking dress, low budget.

"
"

  Superb dress with standard fabric quality ....best for partyware..... 1 good thing is it comes with beautiful odhani which enhance the overall look of dress.

"
"

  This is a nice product. I am not sure for the print which may diminish after some time. Dupatta is little hard but I liked the colour so keeping this.

"
"

  Excellent material,very comfortable to wear.looks awesome when worn.value for money.Go for it !

"
"

  Thes best purchase ever.  Material, fit colour, looks and comfort is 5/5. I usually dont order clothes onlinw, but im amazed at the quality and am so happy writing this review :D

"
"

  I bought this for my mother and she loved it. It came as shown in the picture. I m totally satisfied with this purchase. 1 more thing the material is really good. You can try it.

"
"

  Quality  product, best for some party,not sure of printed design if after wash result is good. Length is approx  47 cm. Liked it

"
"

  Product is very nice...but length of the top is too long as my height is 5ft...need to alter and also neck size seems big...make the dresses available for the women's who's height is 5ft as well...I searched many dress..in all cases the model size is 5.8ft..pls do stitch for 5ft height..

"
"

  It’s look like in the shown picFantastic cloth smooth and niceI am not sure about the size. But I  am going to surprise my wife this Eid festival. If doesn’t match I’ll reorder. But I love it.Thanks janasya…Thanks Amazon

"
"

  Colour is same as pic and brightful.all r perfect.but not satisfied with the price.only one cloth is there in the top no inner clothes.and not so much thick cloth.but the price is 902rs.i think it's high for this dress.colourwise it's good.but quality wise and clothwise it's not good that much!!.

"
"

  Living in the 👗

"
"

  The size is really up as I ordered X's but tha was also loose and also the style can be better it would look good if it were plain kurti instead of crepe and yes I really like the pant stuff it was just amazing.

"
"

  Awesome material perfect fitting beautiful look and fabulous colour combination😍True to it’s colour same as the picture and fabric of the dupatta is super awesome👌🏻Vry vry vry happy with this product

"
"

  Everything is good but small doubt on gold paint bcaz it's one side print may be after wash it ll go let see other wise it's good

"
"

  Pant fita perfect but i felt the length of the kurti is long as it is without slit oly half inch of the pant is visible. Otherwise matrrial is awesome

"
"

  Worth the price. Fabric is so soft. Length and width of dupptta is very good. As a prime member, package is delivered in one day ( benifits of being a prime member 😂) . Order your usual size and it will fit you perfectly. It's a must buy product.

"
"

"
"

  Tried this trending Kurta set from Janasya Clothing on Rakshabandhan. The color, fabric , fitting was upto the mark. The combination of the attire was so attractive which can be easily seen in the pictures. 10/10 from my end to Janasya Clothing..

"
"

  Quality was not up to the mark so I returned

"
"

  Nice contrast. Fit. Comfortable. Can go for it

"
"

  It's really good, but just a bit long for me. I'll alter it.

"
"

  It’s a very smart buy trust me I never go by the review and never even bothered to write any review but the dress was soo good and saved me while Ramzan as I couldn’t go out to shop due to COVID it’s an  beautiful dress

"
"

  It was given as gift to my sister, fitting was too good, color combination was good, over all it was very nice!!!!

"
"

  Quality is not good and it’s not crepe cloth.Low crepe material

"
"

  I ordered my usual size ..but not fitting perfectly..better go one size big

"
"

  Very nice choice... Beautiful and comfortable take one size bigger u will live to wear it

"
"

  The material is very soft and feels good. It is a lovely colour.Pants are a bit short and reach much above ankles.Dupatta is a beautiful colour

"
"

  Just go for it....very pretty dresss.....loved it a lot

  Nice soft suit..Color is dark with shiny foil print.Good for festivals..

"
"

  I am in love with this set and stop admiring it. This looks exactly like shown in the pic infact even better. I am usually a xs and it fit me like I got this stitched. This is a must have in your closet. Exceeded my expectations 🙂

"
"

  Quality of material is very good.. dupatta is good in length...nice colour.😄👍

"
"

  Cheap materialHigh priceFake janasyaHighly disappointedAmazon should remove janasya from their listIn picture still colour is showing much better but in real it's so cheap highly disappointed

"
"

  Colour and print received is same as shown in the display. The chunni length and the top length is fine but the pant given is shorter than expected. Apart from that this dress is worth every penny.

"
"

  I gifted her...she looked beautiful  .. i love her but she dont😞😞

"
"

  Very pretty dress. Looks exactly like in the picture and is pretty comfortable even though the fabric is synthetic

"
"

  My second purchase. Elegant set

"
"

  Received a fresh material at a regional price.Wide range of meterial available in a regional price under janasaya brand

"
"

  Thin cloth and I decided not buy clothes online

"
"

  Extra long kurti does not look good on flat sandals but on heels will look good

"
"

  Super, I am very happy ,material is very good nd soft comfort ,thanq Amazon

"
"

  Very good stuff, very good fitting, I purchase for my wife, in this price range it is a good option. Thanks makers.

"
"

  Pant is missing.Could not believe how can a part of set of suit be missed.

"
"

  The material designs started to fade

"
"

  I like this product.. size is comfortable...

"
"

  Very comfortable, good meterial, and above all tooo good fitting. Very happy.

"
"

  Beautiful product thxu Amazon 🥰🥰

"
"

  Fits perfectly and looks awesome

"
"

  Amezing product Lovely 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍

"
"

  Awesome cloth, Dress fitting as per my expectation,good quality product, go for it

"
"

  Very Good quality material... Fits perfectly... Stitched nicely... Very happy with the Kurta set...👍Pants will b a bit short in length if u r 5'7 ft like me...bt still looks nice as a set...👌

"
"

  As shown in the pic. ...good quality a bit loose ordered M size, bt color is v gud.

"
"

  Very good product. Same colour received.

"
"

  fitting is too lose for me(5.2"") for same size which i ordered other.i personally does not like (chikne) cloth.

"
"

  Price is too high but product is gud

"
"

  Product is great same as in the picture, print is rubber shine print and i think it will wash off when clothe is washed.

"
"

  The package was severely damaged. There were stains all over the package and it appeared to be opened. Moreover there was NO Dupatta in the package. Per product description the dupatta should be there. Very disappointed as it was a gift for my mom.

"
"

  It's beautiful. Just that fitting is little loose. Good for people who prefer bit loose and comfortable ones.

"
"

  Color and the material quality is just awesome. You will love it

"
"

  Both quality and fitting are bad. Wastage of money

"
"

  Quality of product is superb..highly recommended..thank you so much seller and Amazon for wonderful dress in less price🙂

"
"

  Excellent material. My daughter loved it. Need to alter if required.

"
"

  I just love this dress. Very comfortable. Meterial is very soft... Long dupatta. Too good for this price. Must buy. Fitting is also very good. I am very happy.

"
"

  Most pathetic dress I received from Amazon, stitched zigzag because of that neckline going on right side, can't return because It's too late to return the product

"
"

  What we saw online we got the exactly same.

"
"

  It looks exactly as shown in the picture but I chose the smallest size which is XS but still it's a bit large for me ... Don't know about others but for too lean people it may be a bit large and for others it will fit perfectly

"
"

  In this range it is a very pretty n comfortable comboGo for it without any second thoughtMaterial is up to the mark

"
"

  Absolutely fantastic...as per the price best product....nice soft fabric....dupatta is perfect and long and superb fabric...dupatta is worth it.

"
"

  Length is high need to altrate.... Body fit k...dress is super same as pic...softness comfortable posh

"
"

  Perfect fitting, quality is good,color combination perfect,go for it

"
"

  Wow..awesome.. the material is too good and the fit is also cool. I ordered a medium one, perfect fit, just felt the top was too lengthy, otherwise I am Very happy with the purchase

"
"

  Janasya is a great brand in my experience. Absolute value for money. Fabric, design and stitch quality is very good. Love the contrast dupatta.

"
"

  Nice

"
"

  Nice product. Must buy. But price was more than myntra.

"
"

  Looks very cheap. Material is very thin and not of good quality.

"
"

  Its a Awesome dress....one shud hv it in their Collection.....soft comfy fabric..fit n look is very comfortable....just go for it...very Elegant....

"
"

  Not good quality.

"
"

  Perfect in fitting. Comfortable as well. Happy with product.

"
"

  Very comfortable and good material.  Fitting is perfect too.

"
"

  Beautiful suit. Full kurti pant and duppatta is reasonable prize. Colour exactly as shown in the image.

"
"

  It's fabric is so good and so nice.. exactly shown in the pic above..I loved it

"
"

  Color is too pretty to admit it. But it's a so-so type dress. Fitting is also good. Worthy. The only demerit I can say is the length of the upper part. It's quite long. Don't buy if you are less than 5'3"".

"
"

  It's nice dress 👌😊 I got this dress for my daughter ❤😍🤩 size x small

"
"

  Good and comfort dress

"
"

  Best product....I just love it...can wear in party.

"
"

"
"

  Suit 's shape is not shown in picture this is a Anarkali suit but fabric is nice and pant lenght is short not suitable for 5""7'

"
"

  I would love to buy from Janasya again and again.Such a perfectly fitting dress. Gives a perfect look

"
"

  Its beautiful,  actually I got it for my maid girl .... its looks perfect on her.

"
"

  I purchase this product for my mom...She like the dress v much....Quality of dress is v nice...color combination is also nice....Fitting of the dress is v nice....

"
"

  Material looks cheap quality and the duppatta is worst,seems very rough

"
"

  Product same as shown. Good quality. Looks very beautiful after wearing. Soft material. Nicely packed the best thing. Thank you Janasya. Worth buying.

"
"

  It's a beautiful dress however the length is longer than shown in pic & needed little fitting

"
"

  Bought this for my mom... fits superbly well and looks great... happy with the purchase..

"
"

  Would like to buy more like this .

"
"

  Love the product, the material is great, the chunni looks so pretty, the pants also are of good quality and fit so well. A great deal for sure!

"
"

  I like this product and I also an  Amazon services lover And I love this product I was buying this dress for my brithday and I looked so pretty and quality also superb

"
"

  Excellent color and material. Size is as given in the chart. Go for it!

"
"

  Product is excellent  as expected but Dupatta is too lengthy so better to wear it both side otherwise it will mope on the floor like mine 😁 but seriously it dam beautiful ❤️

"
"

  Comfortable, fitting goes very well. Material too good compare to price i bought it for 977/-. So go for it goes better for normal occasion n daily wear too.

"
"

  This product is gud and a better comfort .but even a small size is lil loose so i suggested u if u purchase u can bought 1 size smaller from ur actual size .well overall m satisfied ✌️ ...lookwise bhi perfect hai boss😊

"
"

  Available in road site better than this3rd class quality

"
"

  Best dress I've purchase ever on Amazon. Love the neck design which I never noticed while placing the order. Super happy with the purchase. Thank u Janasya 😍

"
"

  I loved this dress. Very Nice

"
"

  The pant is too small. Would like to exchange the L sized pant with a XXL sized pant.

"
"

  Fabric is good and as mentioned..

"
"

  product is really good, but mske sure its 100% polyster, it is soft but if you wear in summer, it tends to bit hot and you soon gonna feel sweaty. Not at all recommend to wear in summer.Apart from this everything is good about dis product

"
"

  I liked this salwar. I was not that much facinated with dupatta, it is ok ok kind of. But the salwar is good.

"
"

  product is same as like it is in pics, but u need to tailor for stitching

"
"

  The material of this suit is not good. Its synthetic.

"
"

  It is recommended to wear cotton or crape lining inside for good fit if possible. Otherwise this will be quite discomfortable and will stick to the body.

"
"

  Quality of the material is super.  Size is according to size chart. Don't wait. Just go for it. Janasya is perfect brand ...

"
"

  Great dress at this rate .... looks very pretty .... the deliver was fast .... thanks Amazon for this

  Size colour and fitting was great. As expected. Amazing product

"
"

  Excellent

"
"

  Just amazing.... Love the fabric and that too so reasonably priced

"
"

  The dress is nice..But not in favour of shawl, its too simple for the dress

"
"

  Product quality is too good and same like shown in image. But the sleeve and top length is bigger than shown in dha image. That's only the dislike. Otherwise worth product👍

"
"

  The colour is as shown on the picture and fit is also perfect!

"

  Its very comfortable pure cotton dress and looking also amezing and work is also very good. Thank you amezon its a very excellent product. People might doubt it's gold print coming off after wash or quality being inferior but have no fear buying this. I have worn it and washed it normally. It's the same!!!! The quality is undoubtedly good even though it too light weighted. Guys go for it without doubts.

"
"

  Beautiful kurta set , with good quality fabric and elegant look, color is very beautiful, I ordered it in size M and it fits perfectly, fabric is not very hard, its smooth on skin, also wanted to mention that the colour does not fade after the wash, because i washed it just after I received it. I bought it for my wife and she just loved it. The dupatta adds a lot to the overall beauty of the suit. Totally overwhelmed with this purchase.

"
"

  Although the product is good, fitting wise and fabric colour and quality wise, what I received was having a patch on the back. Although I exchanged, but got similar piece again. the 2 piece cloth on back of kurta makes it worthless. Instead of using outdoors, it is being used as indoor clothing. Pathetic on account of seller. So, Beware!!!Not returning because it was used, observed later on.

"
"

  This dress is exactly as shown in the picture. Wore this dress on Raksha Bandhan day and the amount of compliments I got on this dress is definitely paisa vasool.Color doesn't fade and fabric is just quality and superb cotton. Light pink bandhani dupatta makes it more graceful. Ordered xxl size and it is just perfectly fit.Worth the money value.

"
"

  The dress is so good its pure cotton, The color is amazing and looks very nice.. Also the bandhani dupatta compliments the  dress..Just wished that 2xl size was a little more comfortable but still I m keeping it as just in love with the dress

"
"

  After wearing 1st time ..it is too comfortable cotton during wearing...cloth quality and stiching work is too good...unique design for casual wearing..overall Nice product in this prise range...Value for money product for regular use.

"
"

  Material of the cloth is very soft and fabric is breathable. My mom loved the fabric.Size was little bigger but no issue it can easily be altered so no issue. Colours are very bright and amazing. Worth the price.

  Definitely recommended at this price.Not pure cotton but looks great and comfortable to wear.Duppatta is quite complicated to handle as its a different cloth

"

  Very nice dress looks more good then the pic. Fabric quality very fine and beautiful color, looks very elegant and comfortable too. I was in doubt that how will it going to be but this came out above my expectations. Loved it

"
"

  THE COLOUR , FABRIC AND EVEN PRINT LOOKS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE PHOTO. THE BANDHANI IS LIKE PRINTED NAILPOLICH ON THE KURTA WHICH LOOKS VERY CHEAP. AND THE FABRIC IS OKAY  BUT NOT THE WAY I EXPECTED IT TO BE. THE KURTA IN THE IMAGE AND THE KURTA THAT WAS DELIVERED ARE OBVIOSLY NOT SAME . IM RETURNING THIS AND WOULDNT RECCOMEND TO BUY THIS.

"
"

  meteriel is very nice.....received same as shown in picture.fitting is perfect.

"
"

  No cotton. But breathable material . Jute type mixed. As shown in description. No damages. Smells new cloth. Overall good purchase

"
"

  Bright color with bandhi print. It's a unique combination of color and design. Loved it. Size perfect as expected. Perfect for traditional wear.

"
"

  The quality of the cloth and fabric is great as it is very soft. It feels comfortable when wearing this and the size is perfect. The colour combination of the suit is amazing.

"
"

  Superb set , I loved the combination and it actually looked more beautiful in real.Moreover , the Customer service of Anni Designer also calls you for feedback ..this adds more value..

"
"

  The suit is same as shown in picture. Dupatta size is also perfect. Just loved the suit. Color combination is also good. Amazon made me happy. Worth the money product.

"
"

  Very comfortable Cotton suit. It's fits me so well, I'm very happy with its fitting on me. I really adore its colour contrast. Dupatta has chunri work that just makes its very stylish.

"
"

  I ordered the product from Brand-Anni Designerbut got the product from another brand i.e. Gosriki. Disappointed, product ok type, not pure cotton, duppayta length- a bit short.

"
"

  Dress design is good but dupatta is very small. Wearable only one side.

"
"

  Material is very good and it is looking awesome. Worth the Money, there is just one thing the bottom color is dark and Dupatta color is light , but I can ignore this!!Good product

"
"

  Didn't receive the one in website some other I got but turned out nice one

   Pros:1. The quality is very good. I’ve been using it for several months now and it has not worn out even a bit. I’ve used it almost all days while walking/jogging/working out, and washed it several times. No loss of elasticity as well.2. Color is good. Black looks good with any coloured hair and any length of hair.3. It has grips at the back side (see images) which helps in the band staying in place. It will not accidentally slip.4. The front portion is sufficiently large, and can be used by both people with short hair and long hair.5. It’s easily washable and will not fade or lose its quality easily.6. The fabric is smooth, and it will not irritate your skin/scalp/hair.7. It absorbs sweat really well. Note that it will take a few rounds of washing to start absorbing sweat properly.8. I wear it not only during workouts, but also to manage my long hair when I step outside the house. Since it’s black, it blends really well and does not stand out. And helps keep the hair easily manageable.Cons:1. Though the outer layer is black, the inner side is grey. Since the front section is fairly large in dimensions, sometimes I prefer to fold it to make it smaller. However, this results in the grey side being shown and it looks weird.2. There are no size options. My head is average sized, yet it’s quite tight fitting. It’s not uncomfortable right away, but after 30 minutes of use, it gets a bit uncomfortable. I manage by removing it for a minute and putting it back on.Conclusion: I bought this product as I have long hair, and this helps me manage it easily when going out or while exercising. It absorbs sweat well, and also holds the hair in place really well. If you have a big head, don’t buy it, it will be too tight. I tried several bands, from street shops & Amazon, and I finally liked this product. Though this was priced high and had a few minor inconveniences, this one proved to be the best. Hence, I would recommend this.

"
"

  Not worth price, its cost should be Rs. 200 but I purchased it in 399.Quality is also not good, its not absorbing sweat well. Its absorbing but very little.It require washing very frequently as after two days sweat it smells bad.Elastic on back side is good but not superb as while wearing it feels like you are wearing something so after removing you feel a bit comfortable.

"
"

  This is how the product arrived (the pen is just for comparison). There is no brand label to assure the originality of the product. However, the product is of good quality and soft fabric and the silicon rubber on the back is an added feature.Although the MRP truely says 1999, getting it for 399 might provoke the customers to buy it. But this how what the seller makes himself appealing.All in all, I could suggest you to buy this product but if the silicone rubber does you no good then you can get the same product for 100 bucks elsewhere .

"
"

  I am writing this review after using the headband for over a month.Pros:• Comfortable to wear• The material is soft• Good elasticity• Doesn’t slide away• Keeps the hair in place• Stops sweat from dripping down the forehead during workouts• One size fits all (at least most)• Washable: Elasticity has not changed after multiple washes (hand wash and drip drying)• Double-sided: Can use either black or grey side as per your likingNo cons identified so far

"
"

  Too big for the forehead, you don't want to wrap it tightly around your hairs so that it leaves hairs dry and damaged and too tight that it will give your head an hemorrhage. You can feel your head squeezed that even hinders blood circulation besides leaving marks on forehead. For me it's waste of money! That's why always buy from professional sports brand for accessories.

"
"

  Excellent quality top performance and it’s double sided so order a colour as it will have black on another side can be worn both sides keeps hair intact and away from eyes must buy for women who do serious training

"
"

  I like it a lot.It was delivered before time. I used it yesterday for my strength and conditioning workout. Usually, I am constantly touching up, tucking my flyaway hair, getting highly irritated because whenever I jump these tiny hair would just come into face and tickle me. Not to mention how sweat would just pour everywhere from my hair on to my face and vice versa.NOT ANYMORE. I didn’t even think about my hair once in the 45 minutes I spent working out, not even once.The headband works, people! Get it. It’s slightly tighter that’s true, but once you get going and it starts absorbing sweat it loosens a bit and you feel better. Maybe that’s why it’s tight, I’m not sure but you won’t feel it after 10 minutes or so.I love it.I am just miffed that I’ll have to wash it almost daily with how much I sweat, but that’s a small thing for this saviour.Get it without thinking, it does the job.

"
"

  I have been looking for such a headband for a very long time. Initially I was skeptical to buy it but now I'm very happy with my purchase. The Material and quality is excellent. the elasticity is perfect. It has an anti slip rubber on the back side which keeps it in place and doesn't slip at all. Can be worn on both sides, grey and black. Simply Loved It.

"
"

  It's very soft and after a few minutes you'll forget you're wearing anything on your head.The elastic is great and the fit is comfortable.As for sweat absorption, suffice it to say it handles a couple hours of Badminton without breaking into a sweat 😋

"
"

  The quality of the fabric and the elasticity is very good. It has good absorbency too. However, it didn't feel very comfortable to me overall, it just feels like the band is slipping from behind the head and moving up. Its distracting while exercising and I used this a couple of times but then moved back to clips to hold back hair. For those used to wearing bands this might be useful, personally I was not a fan.

Since the front section is fairly large in dimensions, sometimes I prefer to fold it to make it smaller. However, this results in the grey side being shown and it looks weird.2. There are no size options. My head is average sized, yet it’s quite tight fitting. It’s not uncomfortable right away, but after 30 minutes of use, it gets a bit uncomfortable. I manage by removing it for a minute and putting it back on.Conclusion: I bought this product as I have long hair, and this helps me manage it easily when going out or while exercising. It absorbs sweat well, and also holds the hair in place really well. If you have a big head, don’t buy it, it will be too tight. I tried several bands, from street shops & Amazon, and I finally liked this product. Though this was priced high and had a few minor inconveniences, this one proved to be the best. Hence, I would recommend this.

  Not worth price, its cost should be Rs. 200 but I purchased it in 399.Quality is also not good, its not absorbing sweat well. Its absorbing but very little.It require washing very frequently as after two days sweat it smells bad.Elastic on back side is good but not superb as while wearing it feels like you are wearing something so after removing you feel a bit comfortable.

"
"

  This is how the product arrived (the pen is just for comparison). There is no brand label to assure the originality of the product. However, the product is of good quality and soft fabric and the silicon rubber on the back is an added feature.Although the MRP truely says 1999, getting it for 399 might provoke the customers to buy it. But this how what the seller makes himself appealing.All in all, I could suggest you to buy this product but if the silicone rubber does you no good then you can get the same product for 100 bucks elsewhere .

  I am writing this review after using the headband for over a month.Pros:• Comfortable to wear• The material is soft• Good elasticity• Doesn’t slide away• Keeps the hair in place• Stops sweat from dripping down the forehead during workouts• One size fits all (at least most)• Washable: Elasticity has not changed after multiple washes (hand wash and drip drying)• Double-sided: Can use either black or grey side as per your likingNo cons identified so far

"
"

  Too big for the forehead, you don't want to wrap it tightly around your hairs so that it leaves hairs dry and damaged and too tight that it will give your head an hemorrhage. You can feel your head squeezed that even hinders blood circulation besides leaving marks on forehead. For me it's waste of money! That's why always buy from professional sports brand for accessories.

"
"

  Excellent quality top performance and it’s double sided so order a colour as it will have black on another side can be worn both sides keeps hair intact and away from eyes must buy for women who do serious training

"
"

  I like it a lot.It was delivered before time. I used it yesterday for my strength and conditioning workout. Usually, I am constantly touching up, tucking my flyaway hair, getting highly irritated because whenever I jump these tiny hair would just come into face and tickle me. Not to mention how sweat would just pour everywhere from my hair on to my face and vice versa.NOT ANYMORE. I didn’t even think about my hair once in the 45 minutes I spent working out, not even once.The headband works, people! Get it. It’s slightly tighter that’s true, but once you get going and it starts absorbing sweat it loosens a bit and you feel better. Maybe that’s why it’s tight, I’m not sure but you won’t feel it after 10 minutes or so.I love it.I am just miffed that I’ll have to wash it almost daily with how much I sweat, but that’s a small thing for this saviour.Get it without thinking, it does the job.

"
"

  I have been looking for such a headband for a very long time. Initially I was skeptical to buy it but now I'm very happy with my purchase. The Material and quality is excellent. the elasticity is perfect. It has an anti slip rubber on the back side which keeps it in place and doesn't slip at all. Can be worn on both sides, grey and black. Simply Loved It.

"
"

  It's very soft and after a few minutes you'll forget you're wearing anything on your head.The elastic is great and the fit is comfortable.As for sweat absorption, suffice it to say it handles a couple hours of Badminton without breaking into a sweat 😋

"
"

  The quality of the fabric and the elasticity is very good. It has good absorbency too. However, it didn't feel very comfortable to me overall, it just feels like the band is slipping from behind the head and moving up. Its distracting while exercising and I used this a couple of times but then moved back to clips to hold back hair. For those used to wearing bands this might be useful, personally I was not a fan.

"
"

  Would state the benefits of it in the following ways -1. Perfect size to cover hair.2. Ideal to absorb sweat even for full/half marathon running sessions comfortably.3. Fits perfectly on the hair without making any uncomfortable feeling despite heavy jerks

"
"

  Material is good durable fully elastic with soft nylon cloth for absorbing the sweat and covers the full forhead and does not allow your long hairs to come  over your eyes while palying/running.I wear it while riding my bike in long drives.And also while working on my PC is relieves headache a bit as well.Quiet good and satisfied.Deliverd to me within 3 days.

"
"

  There is nothing much to say about it but for those who is looking it for excercise then it wont disappoint you i guarantee it.1. Excellent comfort.2. Great Material.3. Excellent Material.Not for the people who wants it to use during office or work time it seem like you will be there for workout but still if it's okay they you should go for it.

"
"

  Typical road side product !!  Paid 399 for this cheap product which cannot be returned. I had purchased this after seeing reviews .. this is not even rs100 product.  :(

"
"

  Product is great from everywhere be it fabric or material but it lacks at comfort. Seriously telling you once I wore this it made my head paining even my ears were also paininglike hell.That's because of the lastic it has its toooo tight. I wore this like 1 and half day and gave it to someone for free.Secondly the price it's too much it's not even a prabded product so it's better to buy from near store I would suggest not to go for it not worthy first price second comfirtness but yeah one thing after wearing this no hair will roll from one place to other due to its highness, hahahaha.

"
"

  It's an excellent purchase for me .. One day delivery , quality of product is awesome , it's comfortable to wear (elastic is not making any marks on head) , material of band is good ,worth price .. please go ahead buy this if we you are looking for any sports / gym headband ..

"
"

  I purchased two of these in Aug 2020 for daily use during my extensive sport training sessions where in I sweat a lot. So there is a lot of wear and tear, daily wash, drying out in the sun and then reuse. Even today after 8 months the quality and the fitting is as-is. It's amazing that even after so many washes the plastic band stretch at the back hasn't given in. A true value for money product this is

"
"

  For my medium sized head it has got good fit. The stitching is really sturdy and band stays in place easily till medium intensity workout. Band started to bunch when it was full of sweat and slips during high intensity workout.

"
"

  This head band is of very good quality. It is super effective in absorbing sweat whether I am running marathon or sweating out in Gym. It is also very soft. Complete value for money.

"
"

  On of the best products as a sweat band for head, but overpriced !!It completely absorbs the sweat and only a drop or two which drips down from forehead to eyes !! It's an incredibly good product and must for everyone !!

"
"

  I bought it because I Jog & play badminton. After 7 days, it is now loose and it is absorbing less sweat. I also use specs but it can't hold them properly.

"
"

  It is indeed a great product. Happy with my purchase. It is soft and comfortable to wear. Fits very well. Build material is of good quality.I sweat a lot and I am surprised to see its excellent absorbing capacity.Highly recommended product!

"
"

  This was actually great! I use it as a sweat band while riding cycle or running! It works well cos I generally sweat a lil more 😅 not sure from the hair band perspective, but works well for me. Maybe the price should be lower tho.

"
"

  The band is soft, comfortable. It’s elasticity is pretty good. It is not painful. I use to wear it 6-7 hours but this is not painful. This is very light weight.This is really helpful for the people specially who has long hair and it comes in front of your eyes.

"
"

  I ordered black and received grey instead, apart from this, everything is great about this! Good sweat absorption, the elastic was a bit loose for me though. It comes in very basic packaging with no brand logo!

"
"

  Good, safe but my nephew doesn't like. But if you somehow manage your baby to have this in their head, it would definitely save them from routine bumps and nicks and also mostly from those dreaded falls.

"
"

  awesome product which fits perfectly on my big head. its also not fitting tight and its comfortable. fabric is soaking sweat so far as i have received in monsoon season.Absorbency : 3/5Comfort : 5/5Softness : 5/5

"
"

  The band was good in the beginning, but as I kept using it the elastic started to tear and the grip started to loosen, after 1 month of the purchase I could notice most of the elastic cords were torn and popping outsideBut it's comfortable and soft to the touch

"
"

  Brand packaging missing. Even the price tag was missing. Came in a small ziplock plastic. May be that's what you get on a discounted price. So have the product which I'm not sure is a SKUDGEAR or not.

"
"

  The product is good, comfortable, fits wells, doesn't slip and is soft. Can't say much about the absorbancy, haven't used it for a workout yet. Only, thing is, it seems a bit expensive. Still, the price could be acceptable as the product is good. It would have been better if it was available in vibrant colours apart from black and grey.

"
"

  I bought it for my workouts.its pretty absorbent  and soft.only problem I have with this headband is that it keeps slipping especially  while doing mat exercises. I find it a bit annoying.

"
"

  Initially I was a bit doubtful for what to buy, then this was the product which had good rating. I had really long hair and this product turned out to be pretty good.Pros - Its super soft with good absorbency and easy to wash and dry.Cons - It get a bit tight and gives minute pressure pain after wearing it for more than an hour.Overall - great product to buy!

"
"

  Comfortable and good sweat absorbing .. recommend for people going for long runs/cycling and want to avoid sweat coming to their face.

"
"

  Bought it for 399.The product is good but way to expensive but definitely better prieuct.If you get a deal around 250 then dont miss it.

"
"

  I m really satisfied and happy to buy this product... really good absorbency.. comfortable... highly recommended...

"
"

  Awsome product.Bt cost is not affordable. It to be. Honestly 250 is enough. Bt still quality is good nd love this product

"
"

  This headband looks good. Comfort and softness is also good, but the main issue with its elastic. I write this review after 1 month used this product, now it's elastic very loose and no way to fix it.

"
"

  Cannot wear it more than 10 minutes, have a weird width and height. Wont recommend much, not that comfortable also

"
"

  It looks good and take care of hair to an extent. However, continuously wearing it might lead to bit of headache and also it doesn't look that great

"
"

  Comfort: not comfortable. It grips your head too tight. Pulls you hair up. Looks wierd; and not effective in terms of sweat absorption. Bad buy!!!

"
"

  Really nice, initially when I started using it, my scalp started to itch due to the rubber grip behind.Although, it was just for a couple hours., truly recommended if your hair are silky just like me and you’re trying to grow your hair length! Also, elastic tends to loosen up

"
"

  It is so broad that I feel like there is a towel wrapped up on my head. Good for gym-goers to absorb sweat and keep the forehead dry. If you are buying by thinking to keep long hair managed, trust me your hair won't be visible until your half head is that broad.

"
"

  Been 3 weeks since using this band. Perfect fitting for my small size head. :p But in all extremely recommended.My hair are long so it hold them good. Fits greats, doesn't slip. And washed it many times, the elasticity is intact.

"
"

  Very good looks....everybody praises my band and compare me with dilwale movie shah rukh khan...bcoz in dilwale movie srk wear this type of band...so i m happy..thank you so much...

"
"

  Super convenient. Doesn’t snag or pull hair. Isn’t too tight or loose. Just the right band to keep all your hair off your face and forehead.

"
"

  Being someone who sweats like a race horse especially from the forehead, this solved my problem. Very comfortable and worth the extra bucks

"
"

  Looks great on my head (I think it improves my looks also). It is very absorbent. While playing sports the back slips a little so you'd have to keep adjusting it. Besides that, it's great. Good job creaters.

"
"

  It's not been even one month, it became loose .Elasticity doesn't grip in hair.Too expensive to buy, and zero durability.

"
"

  Bit pricey but worth it. I wear this headband every time I work out to keep small hair away from my face and ears. Headband was bit tight initially which gave me headache sensation but got used to it. Please make them in different sizes too. The current one is covering almost half the head.

"
"

  The headgear is niceGood materialBeen using it for a week nowThe elastic band is good and wide. Not too tight and does the work!

"
"

  In this pandemic situation, sending unused and sterilised products is basic rule that should be followed. The product that I received os used by someone and is in bad dirty condition when I received it!

"
"

  Go for it, premium materials for the price... One size fits all! Sturdy and Comfortable

"
"

  It's too tight for the head to wrap my hair. It slips too much from the head and doesn't stay well.The material is fine but not for me!Any body wants it contact me here (it's unused)! LOL

"
"

  Really good for workouts. Tight enough, keeps hair out of the face. Looks good too. Go for it

"
"

  The product is amazing and I've been using it for 2 months now. The quality is great and the grips provided in the elastic portion works like a charm.The only con is the price. It's slightly overpriced.

"
"

  Absolutely worth it. It has a grip in the back on the elastic that prevents it from slipping. Keeps hair out of the face. It is very soft and absorbs perfectly. Just ordered a second one. The delivery was on time and seller was good.

"
"

  It is well made and absorbs sweat quite well. It might feel tight on the head in the beginning, but give it some time to stretch and adjust. The price is a tad bit higher than it should be.

"
"

  It is worth the money and serves the purpose very well. Love this product

"
"

  Its a great headband.I use it daily for my workout.it is really comfortable and does absorb the really well.Need to see how long it lasts

"
"

  This product is an absolute lifesaver if you have long hair. Trust me you will never regret buying this.

"
"

  I sincerely hoped we can adjust the tighness of the same.However that facility was not available.Its been only 4 days since I have purachsed let me look for yhe durability.

"
"

  The Headband is extremely good and it was beyond my expectation.The Cloth, Stitch and Elasticity is exceptionally of class quality.Delivery was on time ....... Worth a Purchase :)

"
"

  Black band is of desired quality. But the grey one is of very poor quality. You can see the difference in the picture.

"
"

  Good Quality Product. The Band is soft. However, the packaging of the product should improve.

"
"

  Fabric is elegant and worth value. But the rubber strip on back is not stretchable much so may not fit into all head size. The front part is not very broad so may not cover entire ears and stop tou getting wet.

"
"

  While this isnt cotton but is very comfortable for workouts

"
"

  It’s comfortable for home workouts and it’s pretty soft

"
"

  ProsQuality is very very goodFits on all headsFirm gripNo Cons - A very well made product for the exact requirement

"
"

  Awesome product ....just buy it ...you will love it for its absorption capability and feels so light on head ( initially it might be bit tight and compressing but it will loosen itself a bit)

"
"

  Tight and clean fit, no marks on forehead, easy to clean, can apply sufficient pressure to help with a headache too

"
"

  Happy with the purchase. Very useful during travelling.

"
"

  its been a month using this hairband its very comfortable and very good material.

"
"

  Could not go for haircut for almost 4 months! And this product came in handy at the right time!Now I love it so much that I have been using with short hair too..

"
"

  A bit too tight but otherwise it does its work perfectly.

"
"

  Me using in gym it is very useful for me it absorbs sweat and no need to worry if you r using specs or any goggleHighly recommended to use this product at the time of workout or any sporting activities

"
"

  Quality is really good. Will feel tight during initial days. But you'll get used to it in sometime.

"
"

  Great fit , great material, great price !!! Love this . I wish i can have more color options in this !!!

"
"

  Nice fabric and comfort.. Value for money..

"
"

  Fits well and the quality looks like the band will last a long time. Please note the band has a grey color on the inside.

"
"

  Fits perfectly... comfortable... does the purpose of keeping long hair back !

"
"

  Excellently crafted material, great finish and lovely feel. It soaks huge amount of sweat and made running a much more comfortable experience as I don't get troubled by the sweat trickling down my face anymore.

"
"

  Comfort but absorbing is not good as you could aspect.

"
"

  Very premium fabric...Does it's duty of absorbing ur sweat... Enhances the look....Looks even cool if u have got moderate to longhair..

"
"

  Good materialDual stageStylishGood grip for run

"
"

  Very nice quality. I regret I didn't order two. I should have ordered more than one. This is very helpful if your hair is bothering you while workout.

"
"

  Headband was good , easy to wear , nice quality material ,using for gym purpose .

"
"

  Extremely satisfied with the quality and appearance of this headband..product looks better in reality than advertised.

"
"

  Very effective. Strongly recommended for people who sweat heavily. Good absorption.

"
"

  I use it for Badminton and I have dense hair. Holds well, worth the price..

"
"

  I use it while playing badminton, soaks all the sweat from forehead, comfortable while wearing.

"
"

  This is very cool and comfortable headband. You can use it during the sports and while on travel. Definitely worth the money.

"
"

  Has an unpleasant smell when you unpack it, thats not an issue.  But it way too tighter than expected :( not soft and elastic as expected

"
"

  This is a band but after wearing it , it doesn't make u feel discomfort. You feel natural.

"
"

  Very good product. does its job quite well. comfortable and absorbs sweat quite well. best for suited for girls and men with big foreheads. certainly not for kids.

"
"

  Good product but can improved but price little high.

"
"

  Headache has gone now.I had been using zigzac band for long and it was being uncomfortable and painful on using it for long time.Go for it.

"
"

  Nice, useful and comfortable

"
"

  Very soft and absorbent material, good elastic.

"
"

  Expensive, shouldn't more than 200

"
"

  It's an absolute waste of money. Not even worthy of 150 Rupees

"
"

  Good fit, comfortable, great quality and easy to wash fabric.

"
"

  Material doesn't hold moisture.... This can only avoid your hair disturbing your forehead.... Sweat will not be held....

"
"

  Good quality and smooth product with comfort. Can be used for hours. Best for long hair.

"
"

  Very nice. Good quality. Well worth the money.  Thank you.

"
"

  Everything fine as ud hope for, except somewhat price on higher side

"
"

  Softness is great

"
"

  The color is much brother than as shown in the picture

"
"

  No complains. Superb product. Sweat absorbent, comfortable and very soft. Sometimes you even forget if you're wearing it. Great for guys with medium long hair.

"
"

  The quality of the item is very good for the price.

"
"

  The elastic band should have been wide enough, it does not serve the purpose.

"
"

  Very good hair band with softness and perfect for who those do workout,  exercises. We have adjust when it above fall from hair.over all it is worth.

"
"

  100% Satisfied

"
"

  its comfortable, optimal and classy. Looks and feels posh. Satisfied

"
"

  It's a very good product, quality is very good. 399 bucks is a fair cost for a good quality band.

"
"

  Preety good product would be more satisfied if the pricing is between 250-300399 is very expensive man

"
"

  Quality is really good. I purchased it because my short hair is growing, looking unkempt. The band width is really nice and elastic is good quality.

"
"

  Good but expensive.

"
"

  Nice Quality 👍

"
"

  Guys It’s an Amazing Headband for Men With nice and Perfect Confort . But at this Price Range of Rs 399 , it is a Bit Costly according to me . But I Personally liked the Product . Thank You 🙂❤️

"
"

  Pros:1: Serves the purpose right.2: Good Quality3: Looks Aesthetic4: Value for Money5: Will probably last for a while.

"
"

  T's too small.. waste of money..i think i get a used one.. colour s fade nd some other colours are there, lik nail polish or something.. PLS DNT BUY.. total waste of money

"
"

  Very slippery material. Doesn't stay on head. Waste of money

"
"

  Totally solves the purpose , completely worth it , comfortable and its tendency to absorb sweat is really good , I am really happy with the product

"
"

  Sweat absorbency could be better !

"
"

  Does the job well but No skudgear branding. have washed a dozen times but still working good.

"
"

  It is really good band with comfortable fabric. The price is really high. You can buy this offline for much cheaper.

"
"

  It's ok.I'm a rifle shooter and I wear this while shooting in the prone position.

"
"

  The fabric appears cheap, and doesn't absorbs sweat as claimed. Given the price, not worth a buy!

"
"

  Use it during yoge workout. Absorbs andPrevents sweat from dripping down.Comfortable and so fra durable.

"
"

  The quality of this product is superb, but I won't recommend to people having silky hair. Otherwise awesome!

"
"

  Awesome and value for money.Very comfortable and hairs not getting messy now.

"
"

  I have short hair, it does not hold a good grip from the back of the head, keeps slipping up

"
"

  Great product

"
"

  Useful product but feel its costly

"
"

  Best I loved it❤️

   It look sexy and so comfy

"
"

  Poor quality. Used for 2 months.

"
"

  After few days elasticity is dropping rapidly, it was supposed to be of good quality, but looking at this I'm disappointed.

"
"

  A perfect fit and absorbs efficiently. Material is skin friendly and no irritation or unwanted marks.

"
"

  Very nice for the long hair it will make u comfortable in gym u must buy this quality is very good and for the modling superb Thank You so much Amazom

"
"

  Very Good HeadBand..

"
"

  Nice

"
"

  Good product even quality is good.Hope to see more colours tho.

"
"

  I bought this for reducing sunburn to my forehead. It's really effective. Even I am able to withstand more time in sun now. Thanks for the product.

"
"

  Quality is amazing and it's washable too. I think the best headband for dudes with long hair like me.

"
"

  Must have.

"
"

  Ok! But could be better on inside layer

"
"

  the product is nice and worth the price.Is soft and can be worn for a longer period without being bothered.Very happy with my decision to purchase this

"
"

  Good product in terms of quality and comfort

"
"

  I use this while playing squash & table tennis and sometimes at home. Cloth quality is awesome but better suited for regular exercises like running, cycling, yoga etc and a style statement.

"
"

  It doesn't looked unisex because of the elastic at the back. It just feel too un-manly. Giving it to my wife.

"
"

  Quite costly

"
"

  Great fitLooks good.good quality

"
"

  Absorbs sweat easily... doesn't bother. 250-300 is enough for this product.

"
"

  Doesn’t cover ears. More suited for women I guess.

"
"

  The cloth is soft and smooth.it is good for wearing while working out.satisfied

"
"

  Good brand but price is too costly

"
"

  ExcellentI run almost 4KM continuously on treadmill, this will absor all the sweat, very much satisfied.

"
"

  Good but too expensive

"
"

  I bought 3 different bands. This one is better than the others. It has good absorbent material. And a good hold over long hair, that I have now after the lockdown.

"
"

  Does what its supposed to do. Good quality.

"
"

  I liked its absorbency n softness, but it hurt after sometime.. Feels suffocating not comforting

"
"

  This is one of the best purchases I have made here!

"
"

  Slips off, does not hold to hair. Clearly, design hasn't been well thought through. Overpriced.

"
"

  Nicly made.

"
"

  Don’t recommend this if you are expecting this band to absorb sweat 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼

"
"

  It doesnt stay on head, it slips off.

"
"

  Good buy

"
"

  Definitely go for it to manage long hair amid lockdown/restricted roam around situation....solves the purpose with ease...

"
"

  Quality is top notch. Elasticity is very good. Easy on the head.

"
"

  Product is good. But price is too high.

"
"

  The quality of the material is very good and also the grip providing threads in the back help a lot.Good product 👍

"
"

  I am using it regularly while exercise. Comfortable

"
"

  Comfortable. Doesnt break hair

"
"

  Very nice product.Elastic used in the band is really good.4 star for just because could have been a bit cheaper in price.

"
"

  Comfort

"
"

  Only prob was that it kept slipping back. If that is fixed this is an amazing product

"
"

  Over all a good product but feel it’s over priced. It’s worth buying anyway as quality is great.

"
"

  Was a little confused coz the price was slightly on the higher side compared to other available bands. But the quality is really really good. I'm very much satisfied !

"
"

  Loved this band. Definitely buying again. Fantastic quality

"
"

  As described very nice headband

"
"

  Solves the purpose. It’s a good product. A must buy.

"
"

  Good and Nice feel. Elastic quality is not that good. It started loosing in 2 months time. Should have been better quality at this price.

"
"

  Product quality justifies its price

"
"

  Its a very good and easy to use bandana.

"
"

  It was bit large for my head.

"
"

  Nice.Does it job perfectly

"
"

  All good.

"
"

  Good

"
"

  Average

"
"

  Truly nice band.Bought it for my 10 year old daughter, a little loose for her though.

"
"

  Product is soft and comfortable

"
"

  Worth your moneyAnd looks elegant

"
"

  Overall good quality. Elastic strings have just started to come out after few months of heavy use

"
"

  ** HAVE YET TO TRY IT**Fabric looks good, looks to serve its purpose.

"
"

  very nice product and does the job very well... i use this for all my runs

"
"

  Overall a great product, meets the expectation 100per. Wish they can come up with some designs

"
"

  Good quality, worth the money....

"
"

  Pathetic , the elasticity has gone ... It doesn't fit any more ... Its pathetic product ... Don't buy it

"
"

  Only for light workouts and sweating.

"
"

  Good headband

"
"

  Product is good but prize is still kept high

"
"

  The quality of this product is very superior and price is very affordable as compared to market.

"
"

  Nice and broad in the front. Stylish.  The band at the back is a bit tight though and hence it tends to slip up. But very good value for money. Go for it.

"
"

  Loved the material, works like a charm in absorbing/stopping sweat. Just ordered two more!

"
"

  Brand name should be printed on the product on back inside so as to place the order for this brand next time even after long time of purchase.

"
"

  Can soak better but won't hold up for long cause slips.

"
"

  Awesome fit..nice for long hair.. no need to think.. blindly you can buy...one of the best product from this seller

"
"

  Comfortable and can be used while riding bikes during winter too.. to block wind passage into ears...

"
"

  Good

"
"

  little bit expensive but worth it

"
"

  Its good and broad as shown in picture

  Good quality so far after a week of use. U can trust the brand and quality but price is a bit too much. I hope it is worthy the price paid.

"
"

  Now he looks like Sharukh khan of Josh. Cool look though.

"
"

  It is really a good product. Fits well and feels very comfortable. I am planning to order another one !!

"
"

  Very overpriced, it just only 30 rupee value product

"
"

  Good product but not worth

"
"

  Price is high. But quality wise awesome. Go for it

"
"

  Product is nice  .... but over priced ...in local market got much more chiper rate

"
"

  It’s not absorbing at all. I had to return it.

"
"

  Good fitting.

"
"

  A little expensive yet Comfortable, sweat absorband and adjustable

"
"

  Ok..needed full turban type band to cover long hair

"
"

  Packing is good.I received the package without damage.I weared the band it is comfort and soft.

"
"

  looks nice and the material quality is so good

"
"

  Just brilliant quality, fits on the forehead perfectly, soaks most of the sweat.

"
"

  Just as I want.

"
"

  Its a very good product, but the price is quite high, a 200-250 price range should have been of better value

  It is too tight and puts too much pressure on head. Price is also high compared to quality

"
"

  It will get loose easily in couple of uses

"
"

  I am happy that I purchased this head band

"
"

  Absolutely not worth the price does not stay on the head as intended

"
"

  Good

"
"

  Overpriced. .... not worthy

"

"
"

  Too small and tight. Good fr small heads only.

"
"

  Should give size options. Default size is too tight.

"
"

  I want to return this because of the worst quality and not fit

"
"

  It covers more front area but in the back the elastic gets stuck with hair

"
"

  Amazing product, comfortable, easy to use, looks good. A quality product.

"
"

  Not worth at the price

"
"

  It's perfect for both men and women

"
"

  Love the product.. Perfect band for sweat absorbent.. Just that it stinks to the core after workout

"
"

  Item design is good but quality is not.Stitching came off after a week of wearing

"
"

  it absorbs all d sweat,grt for gym purpose

"
"

  Good

"
"

  Very usefull for people with long hair..Product is very worthy

"
"

  Good product but it can be teard from sides in 2 or 3 days

"
"

  High price but good material

"
"

  It was very loose and slips and falls on the eyes

"
"

  Product is good quality however the MRP seems to be 199 and the price on amazon is expensive !

"
"

  Perfect for any sport, running cycling etc.. worth buying for every penny.

"
"

  Wonderful product. Amazing absorption. Even after 2 hours of work out, it doesn't let sweat drip on your face.

  Great band . Worth the money

"
"

  Excellent

"
"

  Absolutely fantastic product. Absorbs sweat so well, I no more see a single drop of sweat dropping from my forehead to my eyes. I can also feel my forehead cool. It doesn't just absorb sweat but evaporates it through capillary like fabric. So you wouldn't even notice sweat absorption but I know it does because everyday I ride 10-15kms on bicycle and everyday I had been removing my shades to wipe the sweat dripping into my eyes. After wearing this band, it's as if am not sweating at all. Just go for it if you want sweat absorption. 5 stars.

"
"

  MAterial feels very cheap and not comfortable to wear.it is comparatively smaller insize so if you have bigger forehead dont consider this

"
"

  Its perfect tight...Slightly overpriced, but is good for long hairstyleGood fabric, this would last long ..It doesn't looks cheap

"
"

  I have tried several headbands and this one is totally worth the money!. It's extremely soft and its does its job well of the blocking the sweat from pouring from your head into the entire face.

"
"

  The fabric material is good. I've been using it for a few months and I'm satisfied.

"
"

  Not so good. Bcoz of high cost. It must cost around ₹150 or ₹200

"
"

  Fit size, everything nice.😀

"
"

  Excellent

"
"

  Quality

"
"

  This is one of that product from Amazon I hv bought so far that at least provide SOME good user experience.Absorbency: absorbs sweat well enough, u can find the difference by using it once.Comfort: quite well, doesn't pressure on forehead, doesn't slip down.Softness: good material,bit costly but material is fine.

"
"

  This headband is not only stylish, but also keeps my hair out of my face (especially if you have a bit long hairs). And also soft, breathable, stretchy (no size issue at all, very easily adjustable though it's elastic) and perfectly absorbs all the sweat. Will highly recommend it. I use it for all my training (in gym, doing yoga & outdoor training)

"
"

  It is same as what am i looking for , It absorbs your sweat but your hair will be quite dry . Quality is outstanding but i don't think it deserve the price of 399 rupees

"
"

  Excellent for workouts.. Great quality plus does not give u headache.. Perfect fit..

"
"

  Very happy with this product. A must have product for people who work out.

"
"

  Excellent quality. Good thickness and a quality product. Would recommend this one.

"
"

  A little bigger then expectations

"
"

  Comfortable and looks decent enough and does the work, bit pricey but Quality does justice to that.

  Good quality and durability

  Tummy area looks toned with this shapewear on. This is my first shape wear and felt pretty comfortable

"
"

  The fabric is soft and comfortable but if your are looking for a tummy tucker that reduces the size, then this pridu t does not solve the purpose. There is hardly any compression and my tummy size is same after wearing it as it was without wearing. My waist size is 33inches after delivery and I was looking for a compression garment that could hrlp reduce a couple of inches after wearing. But this is not the case. However it does evens out the bulge so you dont see a hanging mummy tummy after your delivery. I think there should be a smaller size available for this product. Since I cannot return this product its a waste of money for me. I am thinking of altering it from sides so that I can get some compression to reduce my waiste size postpartum. Hope this review will help other buyers.

"
"

  I wanted to buy a shapewear since long since m gaining hell lot of weight in Locdown😁.And I must say this is the best Quality Shapwear i have come across !!  This fits so nycly on your skin and give is such a great shape when you wear tight dresses.. It hides side tuckles, tummy tuckles so well !!  At the same time its very comfrtabe to wear. No itchiness , no rashes on stomach like we get from other shapewears. By far the best product i could ask for !!

"
"

  Excellent product.. can't believe. My waist size is 30. And this tummy tucker perfectly fits me. Super comfortable, stretchy, and soft. It gives 1-2inch lower size from ur actual size. When I unboxed it I thought it won't fit me. This is my 2nd tummy tucker.. 1st one was horrible. But I m so happy to bought this one. Must buy 👍👍

"
"

  I am a size 30 and this is my second shapewear which I bought because it had a good rating and positive reviews but trust me once I tried it ON it felt so light and breathable, unlike my previous shapewear in which I almost choke because once it is put ON I can't think of going to a restaurant and sit or eat comfortably. I am a big-time foodie so my yummy tummy is always popping out as you see in the picture but this shapewear smoothes the curve without compromising my comfort to sit, eat and roam around feeling so light. I will definitely recommend this to women looking for shapewear that can fulfil the purpose without compromising your comfort.

"
"

  It is a truely a wow purchase.... awesome fitting...it holds and keep the lower abdomen lifted tightly...in short it has a medium compression feature which I was looking for. I lost 12 kg after my second son turned 2. Because of which my lower abdomen has become saggy baggy.. Thanks to this shaper to give my original figure back...

"
"

  Admist this lockdown everyone has gained weight. So I decided to order this Shapewear for myself. I received it within time. The quality is very nice and it is pretty comfortable. It hides my tummy completely and the fabric is breathable. I’m highly satisfied with the product. Every Women definable needs it!!

"
"

  Complete waste.. it is not tummy tucker.. it makes our tummy expose more.. when we wear it, it gains the shape of our tummy and expose more.. It is more like a dress we wear... that it Since it is non returnable and my money gone.. Never buy this product.

"
"

  Good quality breathable tummy tucker.. it does help to tuck in my post partum protruded belly to certain decent extent..Can even wear daily as it feels very much comfortable and make me feel confident!! 😃

"
"

  Very nice product😍.... I love this product so much.... first i have so many doubts about this product but when i wore this body shaper.... Means genuinely i am telling this...it gives me so much confidence.... This product gives you very good body shape....so much comfortable and quality also good.... Very nice.... I just cant describe in words.... Bcoz of these product i can wear my old tops... Thank you 🥰.... Buy these product trust me✌️

  This product is good for outdoors as it shapes the body and hide additional fat on the body.It make u more confident and comfortable.Material used in this product is soft and smooth.After delivery my wife stomach was loosen up and she always avoided going outside. I bought this for her and now things are changed.Give it a try....

"
"

  Bought it for my mother. She felt that the fabric feel is very soft and comfortable. It was a perfect fit for her and loved the product. Hesitated to either buy or not but eventually she bought it.

"
"

  Please don't go for it. Totally disappointed.Completely waste product. Doesnt work at all. Didn't tuck tummy or bulges. Very soft material which is over stretching. Feels just like wearing a loose panty.I doubt whether it is a duplicate product. It's stiching and appearance seems like used old one.I ordered it as I heard costafrey is a quality brand.Needs to return it. 0 🌟

"
"

  One of the best product I ever had. Trust me its exactly what you need. It gives a comfort and confidence to those people who are conscious about their figure.

"
"

  It's good one for women's nd girls for waist size 34 above.  It's too comfortable. I'm not regretting for my decision. I'm having lil bit tummy and after wearing this it looks like I'm very slim😅. It's very comfortable we can wear all day without getting irritate .  Even fabric is also good👍

"
"

  Love love love it. My waist is 38"" And hip is 44"" This product doesn't make me feel suffocated. It's perfect cuz of the excellent material used to weave it. Just be careful when you wash it- handwash no brush/machine please. Long lasting beauty has finally arrived. Makes tummy look slimmer and lifts hip a little to make me get that JLo / Kardashian look. Super Happy.

"
"

  Using this product after C-section. Very comfortable and product quality is awesome.I had issue with other belts while breastfeeding. Due to the bones in the belt, movement was restricted but with this belt I am able to move easily while also getting good support. As name suggests, the tummy is also tucked in. Loving the product.

"
"

  The difference you can see in the pic. Loved the comfort , after wearing this you could easily tuck your stomach a few inches . Material is soft & breathable.

"
"

  Idk y no one is talking about the plastic thing which is helpful not to roll it down. I bought after my delivery, the cloth material is good and even the size is osm and perfect, but as i sit and feed my baby it is very useful cause those plastic thing hurt me a lot in front, u cant wear it if u gonna sit for long time, otherwise its good for my back pain.

"
"

  This is very useful especially postpartum when our tummy becomes loose. Doesn’t turn your tummy to a fit one but makes it look neat. It helped me to fit inside dresses that i thought will not look good on me with my postpartum belly. Go for it👍🏻

"
"

  But when my wife worn it, she doesn't fill any changes on his belly size.Absolutely shocked, very loose.And biggest shock I felt that when I opt for a return this product, it shows this is none returnable product!!  What 😦.

  This is really a good product ,comfortable and soft. It's been a few months I am using it and still no wear and tear. After wearing this perfect shape. Go for it with one piece or kurti. Value for money.

   My waist is 30 and it fits perfect....i recently lose some weight and i had saggy belly....... It gives a good shape and can wear daily.... I wore it for 9 hrs comfortably...... Only issue was that steel bones came after first use... attached pics.

"
"

  A must have shapewear very comfortable, I've tried a lot brands lately but this one makes you look fabulous without any discomfort.

"
"

  I Really liked the quality of this shapewear. It is very comfortable... No tight feeling rather it keeps the body cool. Best thing to wear under jeans. It helps in hiding the tummy fat. I would recommend this product.

"
"

  I recieved the product today and I need to tell I am so satisfied with it. The material of the product is quite soft and thick. Because of the material, it seems to be very comfortable. Its a thumbs up product.

"
"

  Very soft to carry ..light weight which makes it more comfortable to wear ... lovely fitting..cloth is so soft rather rough so you can carry it for long hours.

"
"

  Nice about comfort, softness, thickness. But one problem is it was not fitted for my waist size as my size is quite less than the given one size. Otherwise its is good. I will say u can go for this material it is very very good

"
"

  It doesnt work. No change in my tummy after wearing it and I am 36 size.Also my fifth tummt tucker purchased .Useless wasted 560 on this for no reason bevause the reviews were so good.Most of them are bought i guess

"
"

  Was looking for shapewear frm while nd finally I found this... fabric is very soft and very comfortable to wear... doesn't give you rashes nd redness...if u have tummmy nd planning to wear a perfect fitting dress then this is the best to maintain ur figure........after wearing it no one will be able to Identify that u are wearing something for the perfect shape....

"
"

  Doesn't tuck my tummy even to 1mm... Not worth buying. May be useful for someone who is extremely bulky in size.

"
"

  This shapewear makes Tummy area look toned & nice. This is my first shape wear and felt pretty comfortable. The Quality is very good. It fits nicely on your skin and give a great shape when you wear tight dresses. It hides the tummy bulges very well & at the same time its very comfortable to wear. No itchiness or rashes. By far the best product at the given price.

"
"

  After my delivery I'm using this and it's really good. If you wear this and fitting is very good and you get sape of your body. Recommended for purchase. Best product. Body looks good. Fit n fine. Must purchase. Stomach get inside after continue use and excercise also.trust me don't go for rating just buy if you are under 38 waist.

"
"

  Initially had little hesitation on product usability, softness and comfort due to multiple brands, different prices and mixed reviews. But, after my purchase of this product and use for a week , now I am writing this review with happy smile and lot of comfort. Very much comfort, soft and value for money. I recommend it and give 5 stars for this product.

"
"

  This product is so comfortable and soft that i feel really good when i wear it.It helps me to increase my confidence that i can look slim also. The softness of the product does not allow me to remmember that i m wearing it .love this product

"
"

  Didn't solve the purpose..neither it helped in hiding the bulge nor it made my tummy thinner

"
"

  After trying 4-5 tummy tucker, I quite lyk this 1. It doesn't roll down. Fabric is nice. Most important, it only make a lil difference.

"
"

  Good to wear for outings as it covers excess belly  but do not recommend for day long use since breathing becomes problematic when you sit for household works.

"
"

  Very good seller I must say...very gentle..and fixed my problem easily and smoothly...his voice is so smooth..tq so much sir...

"
"

  Very difficult to wear andNot much difference is seen in tummy size after wearing only gives some tone to tummy

"
"

  This is very comfortable and have good quality.This is very effective in shaping the body..Thanks

"
"

  Good Quality! Bought it for my wife an It's of good quality with skin friendly and smooth material with good stretch and thickness

"
"

  I never liked tummy tucker bcz of its tightness n difficulty to breathe. But this one is soft cotton.. reduces 1inch. Easy to breathe perfect shaper too

"
"

  It's an amazing product, but the only thing it's not giving that flattering look... My waist size is 30... Maybe that's why it's not working fr me .. it's best for 30+ sizes.

"
"

  It’s tight and but after wearing it there is no change in my tummy. It’s not reduced

"
"

  It won't tuck in your tummy...I don't feel much difference..it gives a toned look to your body. That's all

"
"

  The tummy Tucker is very soft and comfortable to use and the size is perfect for all women from 32-40size waist. It gives a perfect shape to the waistline after wearing it and it's too comfortable to use.

"
"

  Have worn it for 6 hours straight without any uneasiness. The wires don’t poke and there are no rollovers when you sit. Even thought it was a little tight for me but no complain on the fit and comfort.Go for it, it’s one of the best in this range.

"
"

  Good quality product. Fits well for the body.. My wife finds it very comfortable to wear due to its softness. Body feels better on wearing this as it provides good support  and is comfortable during work and has helped to reduce her backpain and stress

"
"

  Good quality and comfortable shapewear. The fabric is soft and does not irritate the skin. The material is breathable and hence can also be worn during summers without any discomfort.The upper end has been carefully seamed to prevent rolling down of shapewear. It is worth buying.

"
"

  It is utter waste of money. Guys, please don't buy it if u really want to tuck your tummy after delivery. It is not at all tight. It is of no use. I feel like i got cheated by this product. It doesn't serve its purpose.

"
"

  The product is amazing. It fits perfectly and gives my body a perfect shape. It's comfortable to wear through out a day as it is made of very soft fabric. Overall its a good quality product.

"
"

  This is an amazing product.Proper comfort fit and it gives good shape and can be worn for whole day. The fabric is also of best quality.I love it.

"
"

  My wifes waist size is 32.It was loose for her.

"
"

  Superb product .very helpfull .best purchase ever.it does not roll down can be worn comfortably full day.love it

   Good comfort and work well, wire provide good support and did not fold during sitting or other activities, worthy the penny. Highly recommend this product for better shape. Go for it without thinking.

"
"

  Nice productReduce few inches

"
"

  It was like another piece of clothing. It do not tuck in tummy just takes the shape of it.

"
"

  It's really soft & comfortable.its a midwest tuckker. I would say it's hide your tummy at medium level which is good as per it's value.

"
"

  Good productI'll use its very comfortable material to bodyNd also seamless productsI ll recommend to others

"
"

  Please don't buy this ... If your have belly of 33inch. This is recommended to one who those have 35 inch tummy.

"
"

  Good product soft and comfy, took it to wear postpartum because tummy became very loose.Wear it with a panty inside for regular use

"
"

  Definitely worth buying, could be a bit tighter but I think it's great and does the job. Ofcourse this is more for plus size people around the tummy otherwise there's no need for this

"
"

  Fabric used is soft so it is comfortable to wear.I have used earlier another brand product but it’s fabric was not soft so unable to use for whole day but it is so comfortable.....and result is as expected.....Value for money....go for it 😊

"
"

  Super comfortable..no difficultly in breathing or anything..instant slim results and gives a real expected shape to the body. Thank you amazon.

"
"

  Worst product. It does not work. Not returnable.its not shape wear. Dont grab it. Dont waste your money. I am regreting for buying this one.my waist size 32 and its loose for me.

"
"

  Useless product...don't go for it...it's just a piece of cloth...not working as per it's intended use

"
"

  This Tummy tucker is beyond expectations...i have never feel to easy to breathe with good body posture ...love the material n quality.. Thank you amazon

"
"

  Waste of money...no use of it..i want to return this product.. kindly help.othewise will raise the complaint in consumer court

"
"

  Really comfortable and firm. Perfect to look fit n slim

"
"

  I brought a free size product which suits well for me..and helps he to hide my tummy fat. Really comfortable. The material is ready soft so can wear for hours without any irrigation or discomfort

"
"

  It's very comfortable. Please buy all reviewer. No doubt in this product.

"
"

  Very comfort waist shaper..Product material is really good.. Easy to wash..

"
"

  It is really nice product and easy to use .. material is soft and comfortable for any wear

"
"

  My waist size is 32.even after wearing the tummy tucker it was the same 😂So a total loss of money for me.

"
"

  This product does not give the desired shape. It works like a legging works for your legs.. does not tuck your tummy.. does not enhance the waist line.. just a body-hugging belt.

"
"

  This tummy tucker is up to the expectations...This actually hides your Bulges...Dress look more Beautiful than beforeI found it more comfortable to wear and it's easy breezy also.

"
"

  The product is different from what you are expecting.  It doesn't make any difference in your waist size and neither make you look slim.

"
"

  It's soft and comfortable. It smoothens my tummy area.

"
"

  This product is very comfortable and suitable for all age groups,  very soft giving us a very good sleep,  also it's economical and worth buying.

"
"

  It's a nice and budget friendly product. Do not expect much and it'll not down you.

"
"

  I have 38 waist but little bit tight from bikini sides rest fabric is soft

"
"

  Good one

"
"

  The quality of the material is too good. But it do not survive the purpose. It doesn't tuck your tummy. There is no point calling it a shape wear. May be it will suit waist size more than 38

"
"

  Defective product. I did not try it because its torn from the inside as shown in the attached photo and no return policy!!  It may be used or just torn but definitely a waste of my money if no return is initiated!

"
"

  It's a wonderful product at a good price! It's very comfortable even when I wear it for the whole day ! Cotton soft with effective anti rolling strip ! Happy for making a right  choice thank you Amazon & costafrey

"
"

  Very good and comfortable and value for money product

"
"

  this is so good...amazing item for girls health... use it and control your fat...

"
"

  Breathable softness is also good, tightened the skin properly but still belly fats are visible after wearing you can see little bit of difference not as much as you except

"

   Yes it's soft and comfortable.Market value is very high of this product so brought from AmazonThnx Amazon.

"
"

  Very nice and soft to wear. Gives you good shape

"
"

  Only soft but not good body shaper

"
"

  It’s comfortable, easy to wear, and super light. It gives my body perfect shape that is required for any dress. And makes me look in perfect shape

"
"

  I'm really disappointed

"
"

  It does not actually reduce the waistline or cause any difference to the bulge in your middle.But people who have loose fat in the area will benefit as it will bring that in shape.

"
"

  Am almost using this product more than 2weeks .. It's so soft.. I feel comfortable to wear this..

"
"

  Very comfortable, value for every penny.. The best thing I purchased.This helps you gain confidence which is amazing.

"
"

  After reading a review from YouTube I order this product,  as per description it meets all the expectations, please go for it.  ..

"
"

  Very nice 👍

"
"

  Not rght fit . Very loose. Supposed to be fit and tight.

"
"

  Good

"
"

  Damaged product and I wear it but not reduce my belly. It's waste of money. Don't buy this product.

"
"

  product is good....but...price is high i brought it 599/ which much higher then expected....so...plz check and buy when value is lower

"
"

  Good

"
"

  It’s comfortable n material good but not doing job at all lose even for L size ppl n do not tuck in tummy evn 20%

"
"

  The best shaper cum tummy tucker I found till now at such a price. The underwires are very comfortable and helps in keeping the shaper in place and not just roll down in a few sit ups.

"
"

  It's not as good as it is shownWell I didn't like the product much... I don't think it does the work as it is shown in the video or imageNot real value for money

"
"

  It does not help to the main reason of having a effect.

"
"

  Its a money west product....

"

  It's really gud...very comfortable to use and quality is worth..we can notify the change before n after wearing of this..

"
"

  Luv this shapewear,it's super comfortable,not rolling of from waist, no ruff edges, fabric is super soft, light n comfortable n gives perfect shape

"
"

  Does not tuck the tummy at all.. not effective

"
"

  It is very good to have this product. Feeling very comfortable. But it doesn't slim your tummy size it gives a perfect shape to your body.

"
"

  Does not provide the required support and compression. Just like any other cloth. Does not make any difference.

"
"

  Very good product,, comfortable with this ,

"
"

  Must have!

"
"

  Today i received it.....i tried it nd i dont see any difference in my belly size.i want to return it bt there is no return policy...i think its a waste of money.

"
"

  Very bad quality ..not comfortable as elastic is very poor and the metal wire coming outside of it..poor stitching

"
"

  good and comfortable one

"
"

  The strip will start coming  out

"
"

  Never buy this product

"
"

  It is a good product very easy to use very good quality  Ian happy with the product

"
"

  Fabric is not good and not reduce size of tummy

"
"

  Waste of money didn't sort the purpose for me .

"
"

  It's unsized and not cover the belly fat due to loose elasticity. How could I get the alternative as you mentioned it's not returnable?

"
"

  after C section i've lost my confidence coz of my Belly , But this product is amazingnow i can wear all my dresses 😍

"
"

  Best and comfortable product

"
"

  Ok

"
"

"
"

  Absolutely horrible product.The product had stains on it when I received it today. I was very disappointed with it.Not what I expected

"
"

  Comfortable and stays in place

"
"

  Very comfortable to wear and solve the purpose of tummy tuking. Satisfied with product.

"
"

  I received today..it's too soft.. it's good but it don't make Yummy look flat when you seat..

"

  this product is very good and perfect to wear. this product fits well on my body. this product works well on your body 3 shapes Tummy, back, and butt .this product controls your tummy shape and lifts the butt. the product brings your body into shape. this product has very soft material. this product comfortable to wear. the perfect product to make your body in shape.

"
"

  Product is very soft .My size is 37 inch and it doesn't make any changes in my size. It's not useful at all. Don't buy it. It also don't have return policy. I think it have some manufacturing defect.

"
"

  Now I know how older actresses don't have a tummy bulge at red carpet events.How come I didn't discover these sooner! Really pulls ya right in!Sure, you look more 'solid' cos tummy is all squished in, but there are no blobby bits/tyre has disappeared. Its even got some sort of flat wiring up the side so it doesn't roll down, very handy.There is no way I am posting a photo :-D

"
"

  I have ordered this for my wife. She likes alot.Fabric is good.Fabric is soft.Keep tummy in shapeelasticity is good.give perfect shape.Improve looks by keeping body in shape.

"
"

  I liked the product quality and design. But this free size doesn't serve the purpose for waist size 34. It is loose. So if you can provide different sizes ,I think it would be great. Otherwise what is the point in calling it a shapewear?

"
"

  Bought this for my mom and she washed this before wearing and she told that it gives a very light feel and also gives a nice shape to the body after wearing it. It really helps in giving a beautiful look to your dress by hiding the excess belly fat.

"
"

  Awesome product, its my first time to purchase such tummy tucker or shaper,, before purchasing this I m very confused but after using this product I literally loved it.. in future I definitely buy that black one also...just just go for it..

"
"

  Great comfort and fitting.. It's just like u won't regret after buying this..my figure is look totally perfect after wearing this.. Material is also soft.. You can wear whole day without any issue. Good quality product

"
"

  Took this product for post delivery & let me tell you it is genuinely comfortable. Although little on the tight but that is the point, isnt it?Simole recommendable.

"
"

  I'm so happy by using this product. This is best tummy tucker for the girls who has bulging tummy because there is always issue that tummy tucker gets folded after some time but this has support from all 4 sides so it fits for the whole day and gives you a slimmer look.

"
"

  I ordered this for my wife. The material is really soft and sturdy. She feels quite comfortable wearing this. Its not noticeable when u wear it inside cloths, so you can carry while going out as well. At this range this is a value for money product.

"
"

  Fabric is soft and comfortable for any wearit's holds and keep the lower abdomen lifted tightly and makes look body instant fit n slim, Washable product, and also easy to use.

"
"

  Shaper is comfortable , it’s material is soft and material is also thick , helps in supporting the body parts and hiding the fat .

"
"

  It adds a lot to my confidence. Loved the product. Fabric was above my expectations in such a low price. Grip is very good. I wear it for whole day and found it too comfortable. It's really worth wear.

"
"

  The product is really good. And fit to size. If works and does hide tummy. I highly recommend this product.

"
"

"
"

  Love the fit looks fab and I received so many compliments for this product

"
"

  Excellent product...worth money

"
"

  The colours came off after the first washing itself within few days of getting the track pants. (The red colour can be seen spread across in the pic). It looks ugly now and the fabric also does not appear to be of good quality. The surface of the fabric has become Fibrous only after a couple of washes.I would  not recommend going for this product atleast from the same vendor.

"
"

  i bought the olive green one. I did not expect this good quality for this less price!!! the fabric is soft and thick, the joggers are just amazing quality. I wanted it to be baggy so I ordered L .. although it's not as baggy as I would have liked, the fit is amazing.also Super Fast delivery! received within 2 days.I would buy it again if they had more color optionssss

"
"

  Please provide size chart other wise end up buying either small or large but not the exact size. Other than that product is of nice quality..

"
"

  Pros :1) This is an amazing pant! It's 100% cotton which ensures maximum comfort. You can use it for workout or for casual wear as well!2) The material is a little thick. So you can use it winter season as well. I live in hot and humid climate and the fabric was not suffocoating for me because it was cotton.3) The fit is perfect. Just follow the size chart.4) Has 3 deep pockets. One side is an open pocket and the other has a zip which can hold your phone and wallet.5) has draw strings so you don't have to worry about the elastic bandCons:1) little color loss in the first wash.2) Avoid washing machine because it may strech and weaken the fabric3) Length of the pants can be an issue for shorter people.

"
"

  Amazing fit.. I ordered medium and its perfect. Not only that, its fabric is also lovely. Soft and very comfortable. Plus it stretchable material.. fits the body perfectly. Loved it.

"
"

  I got a size bigger but still it is quite tight.. infact somewhat uncomfortable..Material is just average.. i am sure it is not going to last longer..And it is quite boyish.. i wish i could return it, spend some more money and buy a branded one.. I did not want to return without trying and i cannot try without washing a garment.. so i washed it and now i cannot return it!!

"
"

  Very comfortable, material is soft. Colour is nice.

"

"

  Very comfortable, material is soft. Colour is nice.

"
"

  Thickness of material is good .. and size is also good ...if you want your lower little more comfortable or loose then order one size bigger as it is little skinny.For example I use L size and I ordered the same but I use little loose clothes so the size is as I ordered but it is skinny. Overall looks good and material is also good .

"
"

  I loved the product at first but after the first wash, it started to release linen. The quality was good when I received it, the color did not fade after the wash. I machine washed it in different settings and it survived all types of washing, so that's a plus point. Other than the linen part, I'm happy with the product. I hope i get to support more local businesses.

   It's perfect and totally matched with my expectations, I'm in love with it, thick febric, softness and most importantly no color bleeding after several washes.. i love it and purchased one more lower and t-shirt after this aa it was my first online clothing shopping so was little nervous about fit but when I got it, I was so happy.. Go for it.

"
"

  Totally disappointed what they've shown in the picture its nothing like that I ordered very excitedly but when the product arrived totally destroyed my expectation they've delivered me second hand dressed which someone had worn this dress before that's totally unacceptable... Colour and quality was good but deliverd me old one too old... Making customers fool and Wasting customer money

"
"

  Product is good. Material is very soft and comfortable. Just that the product looks like black color in the picture but is deep blue in color. Fit is great. My waist size is 32 and L size fits comfortably. Just that if the length was a bit more, till the ankle I would be happier.

"
"

  Fits perfectly. Comfortable material. Love the chain on one pocket. Design, material and price, really love the product. Though I'd suggest 4XL for women of my age of they are buying it for sports purpose.

"
"

  I had ordered 3xl size for me as I am bottom heavy, the quality is good and fit is comfortable. For the amount charged this seems a good bit. though my waist is 36 I took a size bigger to feel comfortable

"
"

  I have been using the product for over 2 months with no complaints. It's extremely comfortable. Right size pockets. Lightweight.Just be very sure of the size you order. I received a size bigger.

"
"

  Very nice joggers Pants for the price.Liked the quality and fitting.

"
"

  This track pant is really cool, looks stylish. I wanted loose jogger, so ordered 1 size bigger than my usual size. It has 3 pockets, 2 side pockets and 1 back pocket. One of the side pocket has chain also, which keeps my phone guarded. 😊 Length is also perfect for me. Just don't know, upto when the cloth will be fine. But allover, I am totally satisfied with this product.

"
"

  I just loved this jogger. The material is too good for the price. Colour also looks very nice. I have ordered one more piece for my friend. Go for it without any second thought.

"
"

  Amazing Track Pant. Was not sure of buying this brand. But, I do not regret buying this product. Very comfortable and quality is also good. Will certainly recommend this product to all.

"
"

  There is a small hole near the ankle which I realise after a wash for which one star less. Apart from that size, material and color is upto the mark

"
"

  Very much comfortable material... well fitted but it is not for summer season... it is best for winter product...

"
"

  Buy a size bigger than which you actually buy, the quality is good, but the fitting is little uncomfortable even after I got a size bigger one

"
"

  the elastic at waist is soft and comfortable to wear, keeps warm, nice pockets, good materialvery happy about it and will order some more

"
"

  Color is very dull.. i understand that we cant expect a 100% match but this is way to dull. Grey looks like light shade of blue.3 star overall

"
"

  Quality is good. Material thick. Size small . Little tight on thighs so can order accordingly. I would suggest to go for a bigger size if you are not very slim

"
"

  I got defective piece....its overpriced for the quality....not worth more than ₹300Also...the quality of the white patti is bad...transparent...

"
"

  It's just too good at this price. Buy it without any doubt. It's better than I what expected seeing the picture. Totally worth it. Fabric is soft and comfortable, color is bright and exact as shown in picture, design n pattern is perfect.

"
"

  A perfect fit. Regarding material I would say the quality of the cloth is soft as well as thick

"
"

  Iam 5'1 but these pants turn out be small for me.. i bought L size and the size was perfect but the length was very short.. so try to check out the length of the pants b4 you buy them

"
"

  Nice value for money. Perfect to wear at home, go for a stroll. It fit perfectly. I will recommend it to others.

"
"

  D fabric is extremely comfy n soft n d fit is just perfect.Now buying more of this fit n brand.

"
"

  Very comfortable and lightweight.  Not too thick fabric make it ideal for summer. Though ,stitching  marks makes is quite odd look.  Color shown is same as I received.  Uploaded photos are only for fabric quality, stitch mark.

"
"

  The fit is amazing It wasnt too tight or too loose. It seems to be made of good material as well. A good choice for gym or as casual wear.

"
"

  Very loose fabric makes u look more fat. And more expensive than others in the market

"
"

  It's really very comfortable, and material is very good as per the quality of thikness and softness and the best part is one side pocket is normal and other one is with chain. And its perfectly fit into my size.I can say that you freely buy this product, and you can never regret.

"
"

  The fit was as expected, material was soft and comfortable and the colour very soothing. The side white and grey panels could have been made a bit fancy using a shimmer material. Would have totally upped the look. I will definitely buy again.

"
"

  Amazing qualitysoft materialproper stitches and fittingsno color fadeno bubbles formation !!!planning to order again :)

"
"

  The material is soft and comfortable to wear. Also it fits perfectly fine.

"
"

  Material is soft and colour is as shown in picture. The size is as per size chart. Since it is slim fit, if you want bit loose, you can go for one size larger. Overall I liked it very much and serves the purpose.

"
"

  Height is not proper

   Super soft material. .never thought I would get this much of good quality from Amazon . .as I  don't buy clothes from Amazon . .but this is simply amazing. .you can definitely go for it 🥰👍

"
"

  Very comfortable

"
"

  Fit is perfect.The cloth it comfortableI selected L size

"
"

  I wear this for yoga and it's very comfortable. Washed several times now. Material keeps its color and softness. The pockets are quite big with zipper. Will be useful to hold mobile, keys while going out on walking.

"
"

  Worth the moneypockets are deep and size is comfortable and perfect fitmaterial is cotton and thick and good qualitycolor is exactly as in image

"
"

  The fitting was perfect. But quality was very ba, itstarted linting after one wash.. also the colour started fadeding...

"
"

  Nice fitting. Comfortable. Material is soft enough for full day comfort.

"
"

  It is good. Fitting or strength of cloth is good but when we wash it it loose it's colour and when we wear it it the colour stuck with our body..  But all over u can purchase it....  It is good product except colour

"
"

  The comfort of this product is too good It's soft and the material is also of very good quality at this price the fitting of the pants are also as expected I bought a size S for my daughter it fits well and she loved it.

"
"

  My wife tried many brands but this one is just too Good.. cant express my happiness.. thanks Allen Jones

"
"

  Cotton material is soft and comfortable. Fits well. It’s a high waist pant, so it may puff up while you sit. Little long on the bottom but it’s ok.Overall good product.

"
"

  It looks amazing and fits perfect. Very soft clothing and is so comfortable. Loved it!!

"
"

  great buy. looks great . very comfortable. washes well.

"
"

  Material is too thick, good trackpants

"
"

  The product is exactly what is shown in the picture . Cloth quality is superb ... comfortable and fit to size...I have 30 waist and for me medium fits perfect

"
"

  Good one but fitting was not that much comfortable!!!  So have to return

"
"

  Very good quality and fitting it is worth 650 rupees

"
"

  I suggest one bigger size then usual if want to buy. Quality is not upto the mark. It's quite average....

"
"

  Better than expected! Great quality.

"
"

  Loved it. The material, the size and the look are good. If I had to point out, lays for tying could have been more fashionable but cannot argue since it's a part of their design.

"
"

  It's an average product...olive green colour is pretty..can be wear during light winters but not for chilled northern winter!

"
"

  Nice product and perfectly fit........... value for money

"
"

  Good fit and comfort. If your looking for something to keep you warm then this would be a good option

"
"

  Soft and comfortable wear for walking and exercise

"
"

  It faded in 3  4 wash

"
"

  Alan jones provides good fabric with nice fitting and finishing.

"
"

  Stitches opened in 2 days. Took another 50 bucks to get it double stitched.Short in length and smaller as per size mentionedNot worth value for money

"
"

  Soft Nd comfortable material.Perfect fitting.

"
"

  I ordered a Medium size. I really love the thickness of the material. Absolutely amazing quality....no defects found....it is super comfortable. Fits me perfectly.

"
"

  Very comfortable

"
"

  It fits as expected and the quality is really good

"
"

  Product fit is good, but it started giving lint bubbles between the legs within its 3rd time of wearing.

"
"

  Good product value for money

"
"

  Buy one size up. Otherwise no regret

"
"

  After one wash you will get lints on the fabric.. good nightwear..

"
"

  Fits well, cloth quality is good.

"
"

  It has low waist and tight

"
"

  Good n comfortable pant.

"
"

  One of the best I have bought till now.

"
"

"
"

  It’s good but you can make it better. Good fabric.

"
"

  Though the product is soft & comfortable, after one wash the cloth looks beat up.

"
"

  This pants are perfect.comfortableas well. If you're tall please check the size chart first.

"
"

  nice but fitting could be more better. Overally as per price the mattrial is good

"
"

  Item is good and fitting is as expected

"
"

  Product was delivered with time. Basis comfort, softness, color, stitching, quality product deserve a 5 star rating.

"
"

  It would have been better if the tracts are little high waist

"
"

  Product is good and right fit.Packaging cover seems to be dirty like inside areas. Should take care of their packaging

"
"

  Totally satisfied with the product. Size is according to the size chart. Great quality material. Just as shown in the picture. Also got great discount during festive sale @ Rs 549/-

"

  I am writing this review after using the garment for almost a week.This track pant is exactly what i was looking for, for my morning walks. It fits just perfect. The fabric is of excellent quality, just the right amount of thickness and softness. It does not bleed color and does not shrink.

"
"

  Superb material and perfect fitting. This product went beyond my expectation . It is also true to its size. The colour is actually navy blue. It looks black in the picture

"
"

  Cheap Fabric used in this product. Does not last long. Not Enough Options for return and Exchange. was not able to Exchange.

"
"

  Ver bad quality. Color faded after 2 wash and also cloth material is not good........................................

"
"

  It's quite comfortable to wear even in this hot, summer season. Quality of the material is nice. Worth the price.

"
"

  Quality is good. Comfortable fitting. Colour is same as shown in picture. Height and size is perfect. Can Recommend others to buy this product.

"
"

  Superb track pants.Awesome fabric very comfortable and soft .. Looks so cool...Thank-you Amazon.😊 love it. Good one.must buy fits well

"
"

  It's not slim fit it seemed a regular fit to me, only one pocket has a zip, rest everything is good

"
"

  Not at all comfortable, tight on thighs, and loose cuffs , gave a bit itching like sensation on first wear .

"
"

  Very nice product . I have first time ordered ..Comfort , softness , fit ,. . . . .

"
"

  This is soComfortable nd very nice product as expected nd fittings is so nice nd soft also. Wow great .

  The material is very soft , the cloth is not too thick or too thin and the fitting is not too tight or too loose , it has the perfect fitting

"
"

  The quality of product is not worth buying for this priceIt's doesn't look so classy or is comfyJust a normal track

"
"

  Nice

"

  It feels like100% cotton, very comfortable as casual and office wear. Color didnt fade after washing, and fabric became more softer. Plazzo is also nice and elegant. To experiment with my looks i tried it with red embroidered duppata and it was fab..

"
"

  This Gosiriki woman dress is really amazing....The material of the dress is cotton and with very good material...The design of the dress is also very nice...The color and design both matches with photo provided...This also gives very good fitting...Happy with the product.

"
"

  Just go for it. The quality is good , material is also soft cotton and very comfortable. I bought in S size. also fits well as per size chart. Material is little transperant bt u can cover it with good inner. Colour is same as shown in images. Bright yellow overall it looks Soo good very classy also Indo style.This is worth for money.

"
"

  The fabric is pure cotton and very light weight. The color is bright yellow and looks good.

"
"

  Beautiful kurta set with attractive colourCloth is 100% cotton and i washed one time and colour didn’t fade

"
"

  Its a beautiful beautiful suit . I have not expected such good quality at this price. Its pure cotton and colour is bright lemon yellowThe detailing on neck and sleeves is cute. 10/10 product

"
"

  Product at this price was amazing, u can wear it without a dupata and it looks beautiful. I jus added a bit of my own touch with buying a dupata and added to the dress and it still blended so well. Surely can buy this one

"
"

  The top is a little transparent. You ll have to wear a nude padded bra and over it a camisole to make it look decent enough to wear to office and college. The color and material is awesome. Havent washed it yet so idk if it ll shrink or remain the same. Worth the 600 bucks

"
"

  At 1st like most of do feel,  was worried of how the dress will turn out.  But to my surprise it's awesome.  Since it's cotton,  abit sheer.  After wash cotton clothes get abit thick so no worries.  All n all i just love the dress.

"
"

  This is really 100% pure cotton kurta with plazzo set in this price , not bad at all. Color yellow is so nice, very comfortable for my wife.

  Excellent product. Beautiful fabric and cotton so very comfortable to wear. On wash it becomes more softer. Feel good and confident on wearing. Worth buying it.

"
"

  Suit itself was gorgeous but had to return it as it was tight on chest and loose on tummy.

"
"

  What a beautiful kurta and pant. I just love the vibrant yellow color . Superb quality 👌 perfect for summer season .

"
"

  Fabric was too thin and transparent, not an elegant yellow, and stitching was not as displayed in the pic. Looked like a ballon dress. Returned.

"
"

  Just awesome product this pure cotton dress.evertything is good but it's price is little bit more

"
"

  It's not a cotton suit it's a polyester fabric

"
"

  The product looks as shown in the picture. I really liked it. Had ordered bigger size as was not sure if it will shrink after wash. Will update after couple of washes.

"
"

  Perfect fit and cloth material is also nice. I would definitely recommend this to my other friends

  The fit of the product is just superb. It's a long flared maxi dress. Only problem was from one side ie. Right side the flare of the frock  was longer than left side and touching the ground. Couldn't exchange the piece as stock was over and didn't feel like sending for exchange. Would mend it from tailor. Just request pl. Check the product before sending.  Thanks Amazon for such a beautiful dress

  I bought any such dress for the first time ever online. I really feel its worth buying in all means. Please do come up with different colours and prints in future. I suggest, the sleeves pattern can be of different kinds so that customers can have more options to choose from.Thanks a lot:)

"
"

  I am returning it just because the inside अस्तर is very much elastic in nature and everytime a girl wears it and sits on ground or cross legs on bed, it slips above the knees  which is very much uncomfortable situation as the above dress material is transparent in nature. Rest for parties and going out, it will look good to wear...

"
"

  It's really nice... quality was good 👍

"
"

  A suuuuuuperb dress must buy and pls notice that it's somewhat short like  2 inch from feet... But it's a suuuper dress  full flare ........ Thank u amazon

"
"

  This was a nice one. Looks stylish and cloth also comfy. I had to return as it was just perfectly fitted, which might not have been usable in case of little weight gain too. But no qualms with product

"
"

  the size specified is smaller. i bought xl and the bust size is 36 as u can see otherwise the material is very soft and flowy and elegant. go. for it.

"
"

  Best fitted , beautiful print an flowy material . Looks gd on trying . I hadn't expected it to be so . Price is little on higher side but when it fits well then you can convince urself over the price issue

"
"

  Ankle length frock.Fits as expected.I purchased Medium size .I gifted it for 15 years old.just perfect size. She is very very happy wearing this. Ghera of the frock is good enough.

"
"

  This dress is very beautiful and elegant overall the fit is good but neckline fitting is a bit loose its just above the ankle my height is 5'4 inches so the length is quite good and the material is quite comfortable ,it is not at all transperent ,good product . Thankyou Amazon.

"
"

  This is beautiful dress, fits well. But the problem is wearing in the summer and its synthetic so you will feel hot. Nice to wear in the months when summers are gone and winter hasnt yet arrived.

"
"

  I bought this as a gift for my niece with a size of L, she loved it.It fits perfectly and she sizes are as mentioned in the chart.The quality is also good, i highly recommend this dress.

"
"

  Not fit properly, right side stiching is ok but left side stitching  is worse, not fit as expected, disappointing  for me.

"
"

  Fit is good.  But the quality of the material and the stitching is 3 out of 5

"
"

  Great material, they say it is a 2000Rs product and offered a lower price here, which I believe is very true. The quality is mind blowing. It fits like custom made. Very happy

"
"

  Really awesome.my body fit both xxl n in some dress xl. I ordered xl its fits very well.in chest all over.very fantastic maxi.n worth for price.I loved n enjoyed in dress.without hesitation n go for it.doesn't bother d bad review.so go for it guys

"
"

  Nice dress, fits perfectly, quality is also good. Overall it's a nice dress.

"
"

  The stitching is not good especially the neck area are mismatched while joining  / not stitched well

"
"

  It's beatiful but I don't like the back 'v' neck

"
"

  It's fitting is very good but little disappointed with its colour

"
"

  I'm satisfied tq Amazon (quick delivery)

"
"

  Eveything is perfect, the size is exactly as mentioned. Love the material very pretty and flowy.

"
"

  Really beautiful dress..just fo for it 👍

"
"

  Awestruck!!!Awesome fit and super classy look.. fit makes u look more cute and curvy.. just go for it..

"
"

  Very pretty dress, exactly as shown in the pic. I purchased it for a discount and it was so much more worth than the money I spent. Good material and stitching as well. So happy!

"
"

  Nice product...Like this dress very much.I bought this for my fiance and she love the dress. Size, length, fitness, colour, etc. everything is perfect.

"
"

  It's quite long dress.It should be below knee length atlist and above ankle.Somehow it would better if it is having leg length

"
"

  Could have been a better fit in waist. But overall nice

"
"

  Colour is too different material very cheap

"
"

  Quality , look and fit all extremely good. I totally loved the product

"
"

  Nice maxi fit is good material also good

"
"

  Product is worthy. Can opt. But length is not as is showing.  It's is not a frock rather looks like a gown

"
"

  Deep neck , loose at shoulder, otherwise good quality fabric, colour n print , length is ok...

"
"

  Good one bought for my niece and she lovd it ..

"
"

  Loved this product very much.. can be used as casual wear as well as party wear. Liked by all. Correct length for me. i bought size medium, which is a perfect fit for me. but here its showing XL

"
"

  The fitting is fantastic. It provides grace and elegance. The flow of the dress gives a queen like look.  The fabric is good for cold comfortable places.

"
"

  Ok ,the quality of the cloth is nice but the dress turned out to be exposing. And I request u too provide us with the details of the height of the product , the dress turned out to be longer than that of the dress worn in the picture.

"

  Very beautiful dress...I suggest to buy .....must buy product.very happy after buying . I would love to buy more dresses from rare...tried 1st time this rare brand& it comes out very well

  Super cool. The best product to cover cleavages. Loved it totally. This is my 3rd order as when anyone sees in my family they borrow it from me and i have to place another for me 😍😍. Totally awesome product.

"
"

  Best stuff one can ever have . You can use it while wearing deep cut teens and tunics . Fabric is really very nice . Now I can wear all dresses without worrying .. yiiipppeee 🤗🤗

"
"

  I honestly didn't like the product as the way I thought it would be it's not actually the same problem ,this is just a piece of cloth instead of proper camisole ..I actually don't want this as it's of no use for me.Kindly refund my money ASAP.I would also like to mention here that the  it's 3-4 days late but I was suffering from severe fevwy and headache and didn't get much time to return it .But once I saw the product then and there I decided that this is not exactly the product which I am looking for.

"
"

  The product is great. It does the job of mock slip well. Good quality and feels comfortable to wear.I urge to people to understand that this is a mock slip, not a half slip like you wear under translucent clothes. I can see few in the reviews have not understood this concept- it is only a cover for deep necks without having to wear another garment for it.However, despite the quality being very good, it is still highly overpriced. I bought it with some  discounts on amazon pay so went for it, otherwise may not have.

"
"

  I came across this product accidently and found it to be one of the most useful product. It covers your cleavage well. Earlier I had a doubt that it might slide down, but the best part is it doesn't slide down.It saves your dress as well as a run to tailor for altering those low cut dress.Just one request, it would be great if the seller could allow the buyer to select the colour combo.

"
"

  These cami are really great, comfortable, easy to use.But they are expensive, 3 pc at 349, it should not cost more than 50 rupees each cami and 50 rupees for delivery.But anyway these miracle cami saves your expensive dresses. Greak hack for uncomfortable deep neck dresses.

"
"

  It's a quick fix..happy with purchase.I have received the same product as shown in the picture.

"
"

  I did not knew about this product but it was worth buying it. Trust me after wearing this in a party I was dancing carefree without any hesitation. So if you are not open to show off your cleavage then definitely buy it. Also it's really comfortable.

"
"

  Really happy with this product. Material is soft  cotton. Makes me feel comfortable in deep neck clothes.👍👌

"
"

  Very soft & sturdy material & serves the purpose beautifully..... The lacy design that shows outside gives it a classy look.... The set of three colours goes well with most low cut outfits.... Firm clasps & keeps it in place without shifting.... Value for money.... Go for it....

"

  Product's idea is good. But product quality is just like a piece of cloth. It doesn't look good when you wear it undee any top. I think it is useless. I'm not recommending it.

"
"

  Fits well, met purpose expectation. Ive given only 4 stars only for one reason. The lace part which has press buttons irritates the skin slightly.

"
"

  It is one of the most helpful product which relieves us of the trouble wearing slips in hot sweaty weather conditions. I am very happy to own one. The fabric is also good, not the best but a goodone.

"
"

  Terrible.. it's like a cloth patch. Please please  don't buy this product...useless waste. Can't b costing 30 RS..cost me 333 rs and did not realize it's non returnable. It's in a v fine print.

"
"

  Nice quality fabric used.. Does it's purpose

"
"

  The material is good quality but the inner end of the button strap bites you throughout.I ordered 6 pieces without realizing it is not returnable. Now I can't use it

"
"

  Good.... But price..... So costly.... Just small pieces of cloths n price is so high..,..... I can make it at home 😄....

"
"

  Exactly as shown. Good quality. Meets the requirements. Look no further. Three cover ups in a price if one camisole.

"
"

  Product is good.. Stretching material.. Quality not bad.. But price is too high.. Just 3 piece of cloth with some press buttons..

"
"

  Superb saviour.Best quality and prompt delivery. Was recommended by a friend and found the Finesse miracle Cami actually work like a miracle as the product is a big neccesity for all girls to have.  I can now wear any deep necks without having someone stare at me.  Thanks

"
"

  Works well as per pic on the website

"
"

  Perfect for low-neck tops. Great pack of white, beige & black colors to go with everything.

"
"

  Material could be thicker. The lace is ugly. As this is the only product available in this category, there is no other option but to buy it

"
"

  It’s useful as expected. Would recommend the product 👍🏽

"
"

  It's good where the buttons are but comes out as there is nothing at the bottom

"
"

  I now use these all the time. They've helped save me from a lot of embarrassment.

"
"

  Good product and easy to use

"
"

  Product is good hav not washed it yet but yes very useful product for females

"
"

  Don’t have to wear a camisole...it does the job

"
"

  The material is good. But the pin to connect is broken in one of the 3 pieces. If it was good would have given 5 star.

"
"

  Ok

"
"

  Super product....no damage or issues...but u can give all 6 colours for the same rate....

"
"

  Compact packing. Excellent material. Thanks for the quality

"
"

  Loved the product,just go for it.

"
"

  Looks same as in images. Good quality material. Holds well. Happy with the product.

"
"

  Very comfortable n a must have in our wardrobe... ladies, go for it. 👍

"
"

  It covers my cleavage area ...I can wear deap neck clothes very comfortably now .Thanks amazon

"
"

  It’s an amazing product over all . It’s really helpful in case you are wearing a deep neck tshirt. This will make u really feel comfortable 🙂

"
"

  Ordered for Finesse Women's  Camisole pack of 3, received the order for the above item today, instead of women's camisole, by mistake we received very small size, suitable for the new born baby. Please look into matter and reslove the issue.

"
"

  awsome product

"
"

  Worst productDon't buySize is 1/4 of a ladies hand kerchiefNot returnable

"
"

  Total rip off. Shown one thing and given poor quality not what was displayed. Too expensive for this quality of the product.

"
"

  Every girl should have this.. Very useful..! Must buy..!

"
"

  Nice, perfect fir, good quality

"
"

  I felt the camisole is good and as per description

"
"

  Cool product. No hassle of wear a slip  when wearing deeper neckline dresses.

"
"

  Good product. Soft and comfortable fabric. Works well.

"
"

  Loved It

"
"

  Itz toooooooooo small

"
"

  Helps to cover up well if the neck is too deep..

"
"

  Very good and convenient for everyday use.

"
"

  Convenient but not as seamless as I expected

"
"

  Quality

"
"

  A must have product, so happy to have it. Made many things so easy. No need to wear those slips now.

"
"

  Too small, not stretchable and not returnable so total waste of money.

"
"

  Very useful product..the quality is also good

"
"

  Very good product... Would recommend this to friends

  love this that is why i called for more

"
"

  It's rolling from corners, so not much comfortable, it's also getting down 🔻⬇️ sliping. I'm not sure if it works or not. It's costly too. But no other option so ok.

"
"

  Was searching for something like this.

"
"

  Good one. But as per the production cost selling price is too high.

  Had a loose gown without loops. This fit perfectly. The belt has a very good elasticity. Something like spring method. My hip size is 32.

"
"

  This costume belt is elegant. As it is stretchable it fits waists up to 42 inches. But if you have a narrow waist - it will sit nicely for a 34 - 36-inch waist too. Keep it in a cloth or plastic wrap to prolong its life.

"
"

  I have bought same belt from another site n i love it so i ordered it now from Amazon for my sister n it came same but finishing was lit worse.. bt u can manage it by filling sharp edges.. she love this belt and you can style it with traditional as well Western dress.. must have this belt. It doesn't fit to waist less than 28 inch

"
"

  Whether it is loose dress, shirts or even saree..this belt will surely beautify your look. However the exact mrp mentioned above i.e.,1200 is way too much for such belt.  I got it on Indian festival sale worth Rs.259. It was nicely packed as mentioned in the pictures. No damage. Handle it with care. The leaves are fragile and made up of plastic. It is best for simple plane dresses. Overall,  a good deal. Hope this helps.

"
"

  Perfect belt for party wear gown, Saree, lahnga, very cute and pretty... And cheap price

"
"

  I'm a curvy girl and when I ordered this belt  I was hoping this could fit me and when the product came I realised the strings are expandable but at the same time they don't damage the cloth/skin! This is a multi styling belt! You could use it on a dress to make it look more elegant or on a maxi to draw attention to your waist or over saree as a hip belt to give a fusion look to your saree and you could also use this over Palazzo/pants!

"
"

  Its ok ok product, it is not life time... If spring get lose its waste... Though it look is very stylish, but you may look for more options as well.... Neither Happy nor sad.. Vaise bhi Itna paisa me itnaich milega😂😁😁😁😁

"
"

  To be honest after reading the reviews also I was a bit hesitant in ordering the belt.but when I got it I was amazed ..It is VERY NICE.same as shown ..Trendy , lovely, amazing..Go for it without thinking.

"

  - Stylish, elegant, quality material and exactly as shown in image.- Belt is stretchable and free size to fit different sizes but not uncomfortable at all.- Doesn't feel constricting or thought either, very light feeling.- Must have item for your wardrobe at such a low cost.- Goes beautifully well with pants, gowns and just as a statement piece too.

"
"

  Light weight, stretchable.Looks good now.Need to see how long the golden coating lasts for.

  The belt is made of metallic spring so fits any size. The look is cool. Quality is nice. Suitable for Kurtas and dresses. Overall good one. Go for it!

"
"

  Lovely product. Excellent look packaging and finishing. Very good product in this range of cost. Ladies would Love it as my wife in loved it. As this is golden belt can be used in on any kind of dress.

"
"

  Colour and size are good than i expected ...may get loose after few uses but ok

"
"

  I am so happy after see this belt  . I just luv ❤ it. It's so beautiful😍, good quality 👌👌 and value for money 👍.Nice packaging also and so fast delivery ☺☺ . Everyone should go for it. Thanks Amazon 🙏.#amazon #amazonshopping #amazonhonestreview #amazonproduct #happy #luvit ❤

"
"

  Early delivery, good packaging.Love the product and its easy to use!Gonna use it carefully and see how log its going to last

"
"

  The leaves were big, very thin and flimsy. Doesn’t look dainty or elegant at all. Returned it.

"
"

  Five star from my side beacuse of its quality, Design n finish and its so stretchable also. It 'll give compliment to all my western dresses.

"
"

  The quality was really good for this price. Its elastic so u can wear it for many waist sizes. It was so classy, elegant and stylish. Kinda goes with all dresses.

"
"

  Although the belt is pretty good..nice looking but for me the belt is little bit loose..and my waist is 26..so those whose waist is 26.. don't buy..others go for it👍

"
"

  Good stylish belt.. wished they had silver color too for this.. the belt is stretchable, hope the elasticity lasts for some time

"
"

  The product is a damaged one .i put it for return but ther was no response

"
"

  Really nice, keep one, if incase u need it.It will increase the overall style of wife or girlfriend. Go for it. Quality is good.

"
"

  I am Xl, however this belt is stretchable but this belt was a bit tight on my waist I wish it was bit loose.

"
"

  Quality very bad .over prize.Hook is made up of plastic

"
"

  Amazing product, amazing service. Ordered it twice. Great experience both the times.They very happily exchanged my product when i returned it for very little finishing issue.Happy Customer

"
"

  Very beautiful and look gorgious. you can easily match this golden belt with your ethnic wears. like this item. A must buy 😍🤩😍

"
"

  I wore this with my long gown. & it changed the whole look of my dress.

"
"

  It  look  amazing  on  maxi  dress  as  well  as  on  saree.

"
"

  Its look like beautiful but its not good for longtime use

"
"

  Not satisfied as it is spring elastic which can loosen but can’t come back to small size. Waiting to gift it to plus size person.

"
"

  It gives me trendy look for both western wear and ethnic wear.

"
"

  Very apt product to enhance and upgrade ur style and outfit. Bought this for a jumpsuit , but this goes very well even with saree... 💕 this is some product which every girl should have... 😍

"
"

  its good..i liked it

"
"

  Got lots of compliments for this. It's versatile, can be styled with any dress, I have used it many times, it's still in great shape

"
"

  Product is too good and little heavy. Colour is dull gold. Rs.279 is little bit high.

"
"

  The buckle (the hook) is not gripping well.. when u tuck in your tummy, it's going to spring open and fall on the floor.. I don't think this will work out well..

"
"

  The only minus point is that you would have to keep it safely in a dry area or it can turn black

"
"

  This is an amazing product... Looks very classy... Attaching my picture wearing it ☺️

"
"

  Good belt, a bit expensive, we can get the same belt within 100 rs in local market.

"
"

  Perfect size & value for money.Neat packaging too.

"
"

  It's shiny, gives an elegant and stylish look to your sari, though if you too slim - it can be loose. Still worth buying.

"
"

  Nice quality...light weight..good buy

"
"

  I used it for my saree and gowns it's nice looking and very comfortable, value for money. Withbout hesitate go for it

"
"

  It Looks beautiful and fit on the waist crctly as its stretchable it is fits the best fr healthy people too!

"
"

  Gave 4 stars because I had ordered rose gold but got gold belt ! Really pretty otherwise.

"
"

  Nice

"
"

  exactlyas shown in the picture... but it's not of size... no worries gaining fat... may be after few months i will became to belt size,.....lol

"
"

  A style statement waist belt...Good quality, finishing, no too much shimmery, everything is super.Must buy...

"
"

  Very nice product..It's fit me very well.. It gives a more elegant look in the dress..

"
"

  Superb looking belt

"
"

  Beautiful belt, just as mentioned in the details, however it’s a gold not rose gold but al in all a great belt

"
"

  The product is totally adjustable and beautiful, can wear it with any dress to make it more ravishing

"
"

  Very beautiful. Shiney metal stretchable belt

"
"

  The design and look is elegant.The problem is the clutch, it's loose and open's up.There's no option to return.Hence waste of money.

"
"

  Unbelievably glamorous! Must Buy😍

"
"

  It's an ok ok kind of product. May be loose for slim people. I feel the colour may fade after a period of time.

"
"

  This looks amazing...and give a blingy touch to simple  and plain dresses. Also you can adjust it's waist size but not too short. Go for it ...

"
"

  Good for Ethnic dresses

"
"

  Value of money..Must buy.. Can fit to any waist size... It will glam your look

"
"

  Nice colour. Goes well with many outfits

"
"

"
"

  Not best but good

"
"

  Couldn’t lock the belt. It will automatically remove once u get up or move.

"
"

  It's a beautiful waist belt...as it has spring chain..it can fit to any size...colour is subtle not too much gold colour..that's why it is more appealing...without any 2nd thought..anyone can buy it blindly....

  Amazing belt Must buyGood color .......Work with every dress 😊 ☺ ☺ ☺ ☺ ☺ ☺ ☺ ☺ ☺

"

  I didn't find it very useful it didn't fit me. . Although the design and the color is pretty attractive

"
"

  It an elastic belt, looks ok, shiny and good looking. But yeah, it looks almost cheap, but can work.

"
"

  The belt looks fantastic 👌 i really liked it a lot..  its a must buy but felt its quiet expensive... it gives a classy look on sarees, gowns and any other clothing too...just go for it ...

"

  its a bit loose for me. bt overall a vry good product.

  I received the belt as shown in the picture. Just lovely adds more beauty to my dress when worn with this belt.

"
"

  Its beautiful!!An accessory that your an outfit.

"
"

  It's really beautiful. I didn't expect it to be so broad. Earlier when I read few review came to know that it's small in size though it doesn't matter to me as I wanted a smaller size only but when I saw it I found it isn't that small as people mentioned . My waist is 28 and the whole belt circle covered my waist didn't required the chain for tugging or fitting. There is a chain although for the sizes more than mine. I think people with 30,32 don't know about 34 but think so that will fit to them as well.Anyways thanks to Amazon for the lovely product and to be on time

"
"

  This belt is good oneNice qualityAdjustable with chainSame as shown in the picture

"
"

  This was my last minute buy to give my attire the look that I wanted for South Indian Wedding function. Gives western look to the ethnic wears! The chain link broke with a sudden jerk but was fixed by using pliers.

"
"

  Not received the same product as shown in the pictureGot a different belt instead... ordered designer belt but received the plain oneVery very disappointingThough the quality of the product is goodBut Amazon ppl plz go through the order once agn after confirmation

"
"

  Wear it with any dress or saree, it looks stunning.But it's very fragile. It's chain got broken up as I sat . Not a good piece if u sit down with it. If u are planning to stand all through then only go for it

"
"

  Very satisfied with this belt...Awesome metal quality and Good packaging. Trendy belt to be coupled with traditional outfit.  Just go for it without a second thought if you are looking for a quality product at this price range (Rs.429) Worthy of the money. The belt and its inner designs has a very smooth margins and a classy look !

"
"

  Quality is excellent and has good fit....Worth buying.. Metal is good and strong

"
"

  Looks good and attractive but very delicate item. It is broken on the first use itself. The chain attached is very cheap and broken into multiple pieces .

  The belts was nice packed and delivered.. The metal thickness n everything about the belt is good.. It's a good investment n can be worn with a saree or dresses.

"
"

  After wearing the belt its chain broke suddenly after some walk. I adjusted other hook but again broke and chain came out totally. Waste product no use. Only look is good.

"
"

  This is an amazing find on amazon. It is quite sturdy and looks great when worn over solid clothes.Bought it for 429Rs

  I just loved it. It fits to my huge size even and its just a chain that we can hook as per our size and once i kept it, i didnt touch it to fix again.it stayed still till the last min of the day

  I would’ve like an option for even smaller thickness than the ones that are available. But over all it seem nice. Well built and really pretty accessory for dresses and what not...

"

  Product is soo good, I got it what I expected as shown as figure , My sister felt happy with this. We can't get it in offline. Thanks Amazon.

  Looks nice and fits well and has been packed well by the seller. The belt is versatile and can be used for both ethnic as well as contemporary looks.

"
"

  I loved that the belt was neither too soft not to rigid… you can actually bend it as per your size and fit. Its finish Was great. And i think it’s worth its price.

   I got stones box instead of my jewellery. Can you replace this. This is really a nusense. I want the product by tomorrow.

"
"

  Wow such an amazing purchase it fits like a dream !!plus size women can surely wear upto waist 44 inches for sure♥️♥️♥️

"
"

  Whn i order ths item hd lot of expectation nd order ths on da basis of reviews and pictures but m bit disappointed now the finishing is not good nd dfntly the cost fr ths item is bit hgh....

"
"

  Packaging worst , product could have got damaged. Product is good, though not at all worth of ₹499. printed bill with the product inside the box missing , overall absolutely careless unprofessionalism !

"
"

  It fits soo well when I wear it and gives an extra shine to the clothes I wear with.

"
"

  This is a wonderful belt.....i am so happy to have it....you can wear this belt in any ethnic outfit....thank you amazon

"
"

  Product is quite attractive, but there's a plastic  adhered with the belt. Not sure if its for protection or need to remove it. If not removed, then the belt looks tainted.

"
"

  I used this belt on cotton and silk saree and it made my saree draping look so elegant and neat. Go for it. At this price we cannot get anything better than this.

"
"

  Super quality. 2 inch thinkness  is enough.so can use as traditional and also for modern dresses

"
"

  This one is Rose Gold. I didn’t get it in gold. But product is very nice

"
"

  This one totally deserves a 5/5. Great quality. Beautiful finish and perfect golden sheen.

"
"

  Very low quality size n shape r not propar. Shape was irregular.. It's very poorI want to return this products bt site was not there for pick up the product I want to return products .. I want my refund

"
"

  The products little delicate other than that product is fine .... Worth to get one for small occasional were.

"
"

"
"

  Good product, value for money.. stylish..& comfortable ..

"
"

  Nice but it’s not 2cm wide it’s 2.5 inches too broad but quality is good

"
"

  I never felt the urge to wear one untill I saw this totally worth money and looks decent on any dress you wear

"
"

  After few uses the back chain partially lost it color  yet The color nd shine at front part is good and shiny.

"
"

  Really very good materialWorth its cost

"
"

  Good buy

  I like this product . Value for money and also comfort.  Best size  this productthankyou so much Amazon 🔥🔥

"
"

  It's awesome.First of all Very nicely packed. Thanks to Amazon. Secondly the belt is so pretty. It's covered with a plastic and also it has a plastic coat after removing which it looks stunning. Too much care is given in wrapping the product. I simply loved it. It is not heavily gold in colour, it's kinda Iighter gold. strongly recommend this product. It's simply beautiful. Thanks to the seller as well for packing it so good. Extremely happy😊🙏🏻

"
"

  It’s beautiful

"
"

  Nice fit and feel

"
"

  I loved this product. I bought it for my goa trip & it is super comfy. Stuff is very nice...I just loved it. Style & stuff is very comfy for traveling in summer. It feels light after wearing this & you can travel without being conscious about the dress. I think it will look good on each & everyone. On washing it doesn't shrink that's a plus point.

"
"

  This is a very good dress at a reasonable price. i took it for my holidays. The pictures are great and the dress is comfortable too..

"
"

  Excellent at a cost of 450. Make sure you are buying this at the time of amazon great indian festival because rate will be as low as 370 or 380. I came to know the offer after I bought for 450,so do not waste your money. Dress is excellent, a little loose at the chest. Check out my pictures.

"
"

  The dress is nice, but color slightly varies as what was shown in the picture while purchasing.. Fabric is ok.. But according to dress's quality, Price is little high.

"
"

  I found the fit perfect for me.. bought small size.. just found one issue.. this dress is not given any option to open from back side or front side rather it has the open end the neck and has the strips given through which you have to pull it up and make a knot as per your adjustment.Rest, according the price must buy item for casuals.

"
"

  Worth for money..I don't like swimsuits so I bought it to wear on beaches/swimming pools...I love this wear looks different in the pool..or can easily be used for vacations..Many of my friends got an idea of wearing this in pool when they first saw me..

"
"

  The packaging and delivery was good, cloth material was nice and smooth. I'm 4'11"" and it was longer in length and loose from the top as well (I ordered size small). It's a one piece dress means the shorts and top are stitched together and since there is no elastic on the top, wearing it gets a little risky and complicated. I have to return it. I bought it in 407 ₹ and now the price has increased. I Won't recommend it to anyone.

"
"

  same colour as show in the picture

  Nice and comfortable...soft material

"
"

  The dress looks nice when worn however the dress is not comfortable because of the quality of cloth. The dress seems to be good for summer days however when you wear you may sweat coz of fabric. if you are planning to wear it during March to August in India, i will not recommend this.

"
"

  Good

"
"

  Nice quality product for beachwear.

"
"

  This is a damn nice dress for beaches, picnic, pools and i wore it on a beach. Its very comfortable and loved it. Thanks amazon and sera.

"
"

  The dress is good, material same as shown but size is little big... S size is bit bigger for me. Overall I'm happy wid the product

"
"

  Exellent product

"
"

  I don't know...from where I should start...it's just perfect in every manner. I bought size L as I am 5.3 feet wid bust size 36. Fitting is perfect, material is comfortable and looks classic. It's a dress u can wear any where, can match with any accessories. Thank you so much for dis great deal.

"
"

  This product is wow😘.  Looks very pretty.Is u want to pose near the water this is a must porduct. Totally loved it. Had it my cart since long but thought according to my body this was a bit revealing I m not very comfortable with my curves. But this is just gorgeous❤️🤩🤩 in love with it. Most comfortable outfit you can put on youself and enjoy whatever u r doing😎 goo for it girls💓

"
"

  Excellent product iliked this product . The colour and  size was excellent as accepted.

"
"

  All i can say is 'awsome' must buy, btw I have used that belt on waist( that is not the part of this dress) otherwise dress is perfect

"
"

  Product is good only problem is inner lining of fabric should have been made with comfortable fabric . A little uncomfortable and itchy sometimes

"
"

  I was not expecting to be that God but i m happy as well as satisfy with this product thank you so much for such a lovely n comfortable dress in affordable price 💛🌺

"
"

  Good

"
"

  Very soft fabric and beautiful colour. I like very much

"
"

  The dress material is soft and the colours combination are also good. You can easily wear it on the beach. It's very comfortable and worth buying.

"
"

  Cloth quality and fitting is very good. Thanks a lot to Amazon for replace the size with quick replcement service, after request for size replacement.

"
"

  It's amazing! I loved it! 😁

"
"

  Very nice print , flowy and comfortable dress...does have a lining but its not cotton...I ordered one size higher as I have some pregnancy fat...but otherwise it has a perfect fit..

"
"

  Perfect dress for pools and beaches. perfect fit.  Too comfortable and highly satisfied for the product.

"
"

  This product is great... But it is a little uncomfortable due to its strap adjustment.... Rest all great and a must have

"
"

  The dress can look nice on every 1 very comfy n material is very soft . With bright color .

"
"

  Go for it ! Superb

"
"

  Fit is as expected and the fabric is also nice . Worth every penny spent

"
"

  Compare your measurements with that of the dress before ordering. Product is amazing and beautiful.

"
"

  Very comfortable for beach wear

"
"

  Uncomfortable 😅

"
"

  For casual or college going girls it's nice. The quality is okay but not that great. Okay only for casual wear.

"
"

  Awesome worth the money.. Extremely comfortable n 1 day delivery is cherry on top

"
"

"
"

  I liked it a lot, it's same as in picture and fits as expected.

"
"

  It's looks good  but quality  is very bad... after wearing this dress feels so hot... if it is sleeveless and half dress then it should be have a nice quality... but no,the cloth is too cheap...

"
"

  Good quality

"
"

  Quality is good for summer

"
"

  This is a single pcs product uncomfortable

"
"

  Dress idea is good but dress quality needs to be changed

"
"

  not as per the expectation.... stuff is not so good... ... the dress stitching also not perfect... threads coming out from many places.... not clean stitching......

"
"

  I like the dress as quality is also good.

"
"

  I recommend you dont buy this product.Not comfortable. NO Value Of money

"
"

  Good

  not bad not good.

"

  very comfortable, I am 5 ft 1.5 inches girl, this track pant lengthens before ankles of mine, stuff is good, no so thick and not very thin, medium stuff, suitable both for summers and winters. I choose medium size, for girls having weight 52-56 kg, it is good for them. Mine is 52-53 kg, so it is little loose to me, but its good. Small may be tight for me.

"
"

  Used product and also imploded after wearing of only 2-3 times... So totally wastage of money and very disappointed with amazon.. In future I'll never buy any product from amazon

"
"

  Awesome. .. comfortable. ..nd fabric is also good quality. .

"
"

  Perfect....no complain.love it.

"
"

  Nice fit and quality

"

  Thank you so much Amazon to deliver good product.1- fabric quality is so good. 💯% cotton.Thick Cotton. You can use it in both season. Summer and winter.2- it has two pockets with very good space.3- I bought it for travel purpose. Not so fit and not so loose.4- you can also adjust trouser waist.5- stitching is so good.6- narrow bottom and stitched properly.7- same colour shown as image.Overall I loved it. Very happy to have it.Thank you Amazon 🤩🤩!!

"
"

  It actually fits as per size and even the quality was good and comforting..

"
"

  The fitting of the product is appropriate. I like the quality of the joggers. I feel, that they should introduce more colours in it so that I can buy more.

"
"

  It fits very weird also the color fades after first wash and it can be only used as a night wear now

"
"

  Very good fit, good fabric, superb fit and very good quality.

"
"

  It is comfortable to wear , does not stick to the skin. Good purchase.

"
"

  This product is very nice and can be worn in any season.... The prblm is that it's little thin than expected... Otherwise superab product... But i thnk i got smone who used it before because i found smell of deo or perfume...

"
"

  Tight than expected

"
"

  Fits greats, quality is good too! Slightest concern is the prickly feeling, it is not entirely soft, it has a mix of woolen quality to it! So you feel this pricking of fabric against your skin. Hoping it will get softer after wash. But over all satifactory

"
"

  Quality is good. Fits well. Bought it during these covid times and even then the delivery was on time. Good work amazon.

"
"

  best in this price, very comfortable, and quality and color is also good, comparable with brand, waist size is large a bit compare to other brand, i ordered S size. overall experience is good

"
"

  Good, comfortable, made of cotton.Recommended.

"
"

  Material is good .fit is good.  Ankle length. Colour is dull . Stitch is good as like branded ones

"
"

  Cozy and comfy to use! But thick to use in summers. Great for other seasons especially winters! Jogger’s model is so cool!

"
"

  It is a little thick but very comfortable. The material could be better. It gets those white spots real quick.Update: not satisfied

"
"

  Material is soft and good cotton. I chose L size and it’s fitting perfectly. Maybe those who doesn’t want slimfit they can go one size bigger.

"
"

  Thick soft fabric. Deep pockets. I wear L but ordered XL for a baggy look and I am not disappointed.

"
"

  Very good product 👍👌

"
"

  The material is much softer than I thought.A bit too large for me but still fits fine.

"
"

  Defective product, it came with a hole

"
"

  Pant is so comfortable with soft material also fits well

"
"

  Loved it... it's pure cotton and really comfortable... this brand is really good.

"
"

  What you see is what you get

"
"

  I brought this product 0n 18 June 21 , today is 21 July and my pant got hols in it. Plzz do not buy worst quality.

"
"

  Good

"
"

  It was bigger than the size I ordered. And has a small hole, but I was leving that night for a trip and would return after 15 days so couldn't return. But was very disappointed with it.

"
"

  Wanna walk around feeling comfy af. Then just get it girl😎👩

"
"

  Pants are loose fitting. But comfortable.

"
"

  Stuff is very soft also good quality.fit as expected. Recommended  to buy it 👍👍

"
"

  like it..many noticed the style of wearing it 👍🏻

"
"

  I really like the color and the material, so i ordered 2nd time.#perfect Fit# Comfy# Reasonable# Perfect Jogger.Thanks Amazon

"
"

"
"

  Quality is good. Fabric is not too thick. Very comfortable for gym

"
"

"
"

  This track pant has a hole in some where otherwise product is comfortable and soft also.

"
"

  The fabric looks good at first but when you wear it, it start to tear apart from the line of stitches, although I bought a bigger and and loose size.

"
"

  Color and quality is good but better to go one size bigger than actual size

"
"

  very nice and comfortable fabric.

"
"

  Good product, but not for Summer, too think cloth, Don't buy for summer.

"

  This is tooooooo good ! Very much satisfied with these trackpants .

"
"

  The size is definitely smaller in fit.

"
"

  Very nice 🙂

"
"

  Confortable track pant with three enough long pockets.

"
"

  Expands after wearing so while you check it's fit let it fit like leggings after that it'll gradually expand and would become perfect jogger fit

"
"

  The product is good. ..material is good ... No regrets 😁!

"
"

  The same pockets were torn when the joggers arrived

"

  The product is very soft to touch and comfortable to wearHaven't washed it but looks promisingIm 36"" and ordered xxl, a bit loose xl was out of stockI would recommend the product and would but again from this brand if this one sustains

"
"

  Good material..comfortable..looking great nd reasonable price..go fir it👍

"
"

  I bought it for ₹538/- and following are my observations.PROS:👍 Fits as expected for an average height Indian female (5'2""-5'4""). It's a regular fit.👍 Material is very comfortable. More so than pure cotton track pants.👍 No colour bleeding observed after the first wash.👍 Looks similar in real life to the images shown here.CONS:👎 None noticed=======VERDICT=======A decent economical option and quite comfortable too.

"
"

  High quality product from Alan Jones. It looks the same, the fabric is so soft and comfortable, fitting was perfect as per the size chart given here. I wish Alan Jones would introduce more color variants like white, light grey etc

"
"

  Fit well

"
"

  I didn't like it as much as I liked it in the picture. I could only wear it for 2 months after that it ripped off. Zero value for money.

  It’s good for the price

"
"

  not kidding, they are perfect. get them.

"
"

  I feared if it might not turn out like expected but all that fear was of no use I guess because this is perfect.

"
"

  It’s a beautiful productWell packed and the quality is really amazingWorth my money

"
"

  This is my first time writing review of a product because the quality was so good.It made me thank the seller for the quality delivered.The box kind of cheap but with that price range that's the least thing you should worry about.Anyways,coming to the product,the glossy finish builds the charm of the glasses!If you wear them with some dope ass cloths,I bet people will think its some luxury brand glasses.10/10 recommendedJust go for it!

"
"

  Fav color black. Doesn’t look cheap I love it ..however didn’t like the box …wish they could provide a nice case instead of that box. (Box little damage at the side)

   If you are looking for good quality, affordable sunglasses, go for this one. Just unpacked it and I love the quality. Aren't too loose or too tight. Just fits perfectly.

"
"

  I purchase the light pink sunglass.It's beautiful however it is quite different from the displayed picture.It's more of a reddish tint rather than baby pink so it is kind of dissapointing.Besides that the sunglass itself is pretty good

   It's flawless nd also I received the package today so I don't know how well it gonna remain after uses but it seems to be of good quality nd for the price quoted it's the best one,go for it

"
"

  If I had to choose between 3 and 4 stars, 3.5 was my preference. Not gonna lie it looks pretty legit and sturdy and also of good quality. It is not as smooth as you would expect when it is being opened and there is a faint creaking sound when wearing it. It seems that when the handles are closed, they don't close completely (pic attached) or maybe I just do not understand sunglasses as much. The packaging is adequate, as I read reviews and thought I would receive a black case with a golden latch, but I did not.

"

  Wow. Very smart sunglass. But you did not provide the SUNGLASS CASE. You just gave a paper box, to keep the sunglass. Its very cheap to carry a elegant sunglass in paper box. You shold provide a good stong sunglass case.

"
"

  I ordered it because I heard it's unisex and the design is very trendy. It was too small for me so I gave it to my sister. Don't order if you think you have a bigger head size than an average head size.

"
"

  Sunglass case could be better!!

"
"

  You can either look like a complete idiot or you can rock this with a chic style.If your face is a normal sized i think  it would be too big for you. But still good for the price. Sturdy and it does the job as a sunglass.

  Cool product for the price. Also I have a large head and it looks quite okay.

"

  Really cool shades, I love the brown lepord prints!It's warm toned, more on darker side. Very good for vision. Especially on bright sunny days.

   The Packaging and the quality is so great , I'm really blown away they are selling them ,for such a cheap prize, I love this product really,it's worth a penny

"
"

  It was bit too tight and looked weird on me. Thought to return but the delivery boy rejected the return saying there is a leather pouch with it! There was no leather pouch but only plastic cover n a piece of cloth in the first place. Kindly accept the return and refund!!!

"
"

  The wooden box not included as i ordered only with the expectation of that box.packaging was same as the shades we see on the footpath according to which the price is way to high.bad experience.dont get fool like me.

"
"

  surprisingly very good, sturdy quality with no headache inducing glass quality. Very satisfied and will buy again in another color

"
"

  They're amazing! Super affordable and super trendy. The quality is good too. I reccomend!

"
"

  A very good build quilty use it for your trending reels or wear it with class outfit it goes well.

"
"

  The product was good but the box that it came in was completely broken.

"
"

  The best thing i bought on amazon!So cute, fits well and is sturdy (won't break).Fashionable but not too sure if they are good for the eyes for actual use of sunglasses (due to price).But other wise I REALLY love it.

"
"

  U know what I wasn't expecting much that I'll be getting this sunglasses into lower budget....and I really love the sunglasses....it's classy as well as trendy in fashion... would highly recommend this...go get yours now!!

"
"

  Affordable price for an item so trendy

"

  Glasses are pretty nice for the price . I expected to get the cover since other reviewers also got it but nonetheless the product is really good

"
"

  Quality iss good according to price and value for money and delivery also on time and without any disturbance and if u have a big face dnt go for it try to find some big size..!!

"
"

  Great Quality

"
"

  Makes me feel like a bad bish

"
"

  These glasses are sturdy and sleek but they are TIGHT. They will cause a headache if worn more than 10 minutes at a time. Returned them for this very reason.

"
"

  I really like this product it’s so cool and well fitted and also look good on everyone. So I would really recommend it

"
"

  Loved its look and quality. But packaging vould be better, it was not same as shown in reviews

  It looks bit large on my face otherwise good quality ...also they don't give the fancy box now. The frame looks big irl.

"

  Black one is 10/10...Blue one is a way too darker than shown in the picture, looks weird

  I have them in the leopard and black colour and I want to order them again to gift my friend because the quality of these sunglasses are so good and I recommend these to everyone. But I do think they should have them in neutral colours too BECAUSE THEN, I AM BUYING ALL OF THEM!!!

"
"

  A little bigger than expected an the glasses are a little see through but other than that its good for the price.

"
"

  The product is ok, but disappointed wasn't expecting that kind of a box , I was expecting a good box which was shown on Amazon photos, but received with a useless one , I thought of giving a gift for my cousin but due to dislike of the box have to buy another box , money wasted

   Its worth spending money into it.. Comes in a safe package so don’t worry about damages.. If you want a latest trending rectangle sunglasses, go for it.. I just loved it ❤️

"
"

  All over it is nice and good for the price(rs449). It has only one defect and that is its unsymmetry as you can see in photo one side of the glass is very high it dosen't fit properly on my face it looks weird.

"
"

  Was expecting eagerly but the box came broken as well as the frame inside.Kinda disappointed.Please look into packaging other than that it’s a great dupe

"
"

  Never expected thiss good quality in this cheap price , really in love with this sunnies 😍 😭 😄 😎

"
"

  Loved the glasses. Although, packaging of the product is literally worst. Could have given a case rather. Glasses otherwise fit perfectly.

"
"

  Way more amazing than I expected... I have ordered it in brown.. I'm also gonna order the black one It's worth the price... Grab it guys

"
"

  The glasses came broken and the quality was really bad. The plastic is very delicate and will not last long. Waste of money and time.

"
"

  I got them in 3 colors the box and quality worth it for the pricing range. And also the delivery.

"
"

  What you waiting for just go for it , it’s trendy and would be perfect for hot girl summer yayy

"
"

  Best a great product with good quality.its worth it must go for itt it it it it it it it

  Good Material

"
"

  I was eagerly waiting for this material,but I was little disappointed because I thought the embroidery which is there on the front is some thread work,but it's just painting,I have to see whether it will be there or vanish after washing

"
"

  I like this dress material very much....the quality of this cloth is pure cotton....and value for money...the dupatta is also pure cotton....I like it very Much.

"
"

  When it is mentioned  as cotton we expect u to send that but this material is purely synthetic which is difficult to wear in chennai. Print is good

"
"

  Received the same as shown and material is part 👌at this price range

  This item is not good. Fabric is not thick as and looks not like pure cotton.

  I’m a heavy chested who got tough time when it comes to wearing back less and Plunge necks.I always had to go with wearing bra, but this helped me to stick it up and wear these clothes with out worrying and with greater confidence of not ruining my fashion.

"
"

  Worth a buy. Works fine. Just watch YouTube video first how to use it.

"
"

  Solves the purpose. Can use this for strapless and backless without a bra. Need to be careful and patient while removing or it may hurt your skin. Can cause itchyness if worn for a long time. Overall, good.

"
"

  It doesn't hold up for more then 10mins.. a complete waste. Don't even think of buying.

"
"

  Doesn't stick or stretch as expected. Waste of money.

"
"

  I read bad reviews about this tape first, but still I ordered it and trust me it’s really amazing, very sticky and long lasting. Must buy it and you can wear it under any clothes.

"
"

  I purchased and it's not sticking properly..it's like a bandage kind of...waste of money I could say...clue very bad...

"
"

  Not good

"

  Don't buy, doesn't stick for long it keeps coming off

  Its does not stick very well

"

  Not aboe to hold the weight and can’t stick properly as well it’s intangible among each other

"
"

  It’s useless don’t buy it.

"
"

  Pretty small..not for busty girls

"
"

  Perfect for lifting & short blouses

"
"

  Low quality...useless item

"
"

  It does not stick that's it...

"
"

  Serves the purpose. Now wear backless dresses with confidence. Have been looking for such a product for a long time.

  Amazing quality pants and worth the money...I'm not a person who writes reviews..but this company is worth it...this is my 4th order from aka chik and they always been uptown the mark..will shop more ..and the product is just as shown in the picture

"
"

  Awesome ......perfect fitting....dont think much go for it ...you won't regret

"
"

  I m heavier at the bottom of my body as thighs , and hips area, but it does hugs perfectly to all the areas , gives perfect flared look, if u are having same structure asni mensioned go for this pant, hopefully it won't disappoint you, as well as pretty much comfortable . Go one size down prefferebly . My size was 34"". Where I usually wear 36"".

"
"

  The product which I recieved on return is an old and used piece. The pocket cloth is of poor quality. The color is faded. It looks like somebody has used it.. washed it and return it back to the Amazon. Because I have returned it once, I can't do that again as Amazon only gives you option to exchange the product one time only. I hope to recieved the refund.I loved the original one though.

"
"

  Overall the pants were nice. But the elastic was loose and the band was quite huge. The length was also short. I had to get it altered for the elastic and had to shorten the length to make it like capri pants. I don’t know how it will be after washing.

"
"

  The product is much as per my expectation... it is a joy to find a pair of perfect fitting jeans and this is one of those things.... very happy with my purchase... I have purchased many other variations from this brand and I loved each and every purchase of mine....

"
"

  I like it! I orded a bit bigger size according to my height so its loose for me! But we can just fit it right? Its comfortable and light! I wish it had waist loops so that I could use a belt. But anyways I am happy with my purchase!

"
"

  Lovely jeans!! Perfect fit , soft comfortable fabric!! Just love it !!

"
"

  This what I wanted after a long search . Very very comfortable especially for those who have legs n knee pain problems. Colour too too good . Made from soft material.

  Very good comfortable and perfect size.material too is very nice..

"
"

  Best fit ever. This was the best buy in ages. It hides all my pregnancyfat!! True value for money.

"
"

  The jeans was as expected and comfortable .price could have been a little less.material not as thick as regular jeans but that was expected

"
"

  While using it for 2-3 times. Its kneel came out. Its looks good for the first time but it looks stretchy after that. Not recommended.

"
"

  The fitting is good, looks stylish, pair it with a nice tee and sneakers, that completes the look

"
"

  It's a good purchase, I felt according to the clothing quality, a bit overpriced.

"
"

  Nice product but the fabric quality is not that good as per the price and it's too loose. I purchased 28 size.

"
"

  Fits perfectly! Material is soft and comfy thick enough as well as thin enough to be breathy

"
"

  I love this jean! I love the fit!!! I love the price!!! So comfortable and give classy looks.thank you Amazon!!

"
"

  I ordered a size 28, which fit me perfectly. I bought is during a sale so the price of the product was less than half for me. The quality was really good, denim is soft and doesn’t look cheap. Overall a very good purchase for everyday use.

"
"

  Liked the get up as per fashion and comfort

"
"

  One of my smartest purchase. Awsome product.  Affordable. Just go for it. Thick material.

"
"

  Pls check size and buy. Mine is soo big for a large. Pls buy one size smaller. But amazing quality. Very comfortable.

"
"

  Good product in the affordable price

"
"

  I loved this product. When i buy the heans from shops, either it will get damaged or it will tight/loose. But this one wer perfect fit for me. And i loved the pattern and style of the jeans😍🔥

"
"

  Love love love , the fit ,the flare amd the quality . Worth tge money , so comfy and so chic . Go for it guys!

"
"

  Cloth material thick unexpectedly good, good fitting, long for short people that can be altered, trendy, can be worn with trainers or heels, color not perfectly black-the only drawback.

"
"

  This is truly great deal..the jeans is flared and fabric is soft.It gives you really smart look .

"
"

  One of my best buys from Amazon. Really good quality product very comfortable yet stylish perfect for the summer season. Totally go for it.

"
"

  It is worth the money.

"
"

  It's good product at price range but quality or fabric can be much better consider close to rs1000 budget renge

"
"

  Loved it. It looks really loose n gives skirt kinda look. Really comfortable movie time jeans.

"
"

  Nice

"
"

  It's very comfortable jeans I really loved this

"
"

  Over all product is good but too much wide and long.
