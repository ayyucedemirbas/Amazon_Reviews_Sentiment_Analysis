"Bob Woodward (with Robert Costa) gives readers his third and final book about the Trump Presidency. As with all of these books, there are many surprising, sometimes shocking, revelations based on interviews with DC insiders. This book begins with an eye opening flashforward, describing how General Milley (Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff) on Jan 8, 2021 tried to assure Chinese officials that Trump was not going to launch an attack against them. Nancy Pelosi and others had talked to Milley about their concerns that Trump was dangerously unstable mentally. The first third of the book, however, focuses on the last year of Trumps Presidency, as well as Joe Bidens campaign for the Democratic nomination and later his race against Trump. I found this part of the book rather superficial, but Woodward does at times provide yet more disturbing evidence of Trumps erratic behavior. For example, Trump tries to bully the FDA Director to rush approval of a COVID vaccine regardless of the safety risks. The second part of the book I found the most interesting, as Woodward describes in detail Trumps relentless and insidious efforts to overturn the election results. Perhaps this was predictable, but it is shocking to read about the numerous Republicans who supported Trumps attempt to undermine the Constitution. Even more shocking is how close they came, much closer than I suspect most Americans realize. The last part of the book covers Bidens initial six months of his Presidency, especially his efforts to combat COVID, pass a relief funding bill through Congress, and withdraw from Afghanistan. Overall, I found this book to be often fascinating reading, even though I think that the authors tried to cover too much ground. It is unfortunate that some readers (and reviewers) see this book as a partisan attack on Trump. The primary message of this book for me concerns the dangerous future US society faces when those in power create a cascade of lies in order to undermine elections, the cornerstone of democracy.",
"Bob Woodward is making big money with his lies and half truths just like every other book he s written. I ll never buy anything with his name on it again.",
"This is a great book Bob and Robert did a wonderful job.",
"Unlike the other two volumes in this series, Woodward and Costa don’t even try report in a neutral manner. Their bias is evident and any supporters of Trump or those looking for equity are going to be considering whether or not throwing the book or e-reader is enough to alleviate their RAGE.Most readers will be hooked reading the prologue. It’s what great espionage books and movies are sprung from. The conversation between Milley and Pelosi should be actionable. According to the publisher, there are 200 interviews used in the making of this tome. It’s very readable and more of the same theater starring good Dems and bad GOP. They were tape recorded but deep background, so no names allowed; typical CYA, cowardly participation.At one point, General Milley wonders if he might have gone too far, over stepped his authority or subverted the president. After the last few months in Afghanistan and the ongoing disaster at our southern border, PERIL most definitely remains",
"The content of the book is a complete liberal hack job on President Trump. The book should be listed in Fantasy or Liberalism for Dummies.",
"This book should be read by all freedom-loving Americans. It will scare the hell out of you to see just how close our government was to being overthrown by a neo-Fascist cabal. Not the best book to read in bed. You wont get any sleep afterward. All the horror stories you may have heard about the previous administration are true and exposed in this book, documented and cross-referenced. Be afraid, be very afraid.",
"A riveting read and one that will keep me up for many nights",
"I have read many of Woodwards books. He used to really be great at pulling out the real story. This book is like the last few, very partisan. So who is really lying here? Roll the dice. Bottom line, no real truth or talk of the great things Trump did for the nation. All political spin. Just watch MSNBC for support.",
"Just more lies lies lies",

"With the new transparency mode, I can listen to music knowing that I will never be ran over by a car on the street again. Another W for Tim Cook and the boys",
"They fire",
"Love Apple products but Im tired of their games With the iPhone 11 they introduced the new charging end (not the one that goes into the phone, the one that plugs into the cube then into the receptacle).The AirPods pro comes with the same cable but no cube. This means if you dont have an iPhone product you cant charge these period. And the charging wire it comes with is worthless unless you’ve already bought an iPhone 11 Apple charges a ridiculous premium for their products. They should back it with the proper hardware",
